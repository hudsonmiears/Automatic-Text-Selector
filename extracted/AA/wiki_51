Kate Kelly

Catherine Ada Kelly (12 July 1863 – October 1898), known as Kate Kelly, was a younger sister of Australian bushranger Ned Kelly. 
Kate Kelly was born in Beveridge, Victoria, Australia, in a house built by her parents, John "Red" Kelly and Ellen Quinn. Kate was their seventh child. The family moved to Avenel soon after her birth, where another child, Grace, was born. John Kelly died of dropsy when Kate was four years old. Ellen Kelly then moved the family to her sister's house at Greta. One year later, the family moved again, to a two-room hut on their own land at Eleven Mile Creek. Kate helped her mother bring up the family, which included three more children by Ellen's second husband, George King.
The Kellys had already had a long history of trouble with the police. Alexander Fitzpatrick, a young policeman, went to the house on 15 April 1878. He was drunk, and said he wanted to arrest Dan Kelly for horse stealing. He sexually assaulted Kate, and her family tried to help her. Historians can not agree on what really happened next.
Fitzpatrick went back to Benalla Police Station and said that Ellen Kelly had hit him on the head with shovel. He also said that Dan Kelly had hit him, and Ned Kelly had tried to shoot him. William Skillion, Kate's brother-in-law, and William Williamson a neighbour of the Kellys, were also said to have hurt him. Ned Kelly said that he was not at the house, but working on a farm 400 miles away, though most historians believe he was at the house with Joe Byrne.
Ellen Kelly was sent to prison for three years for trying to kill Fitzpatrick; Williamson and Skillion were sent for six year. Ned and Dan Kelly hid at Bullock Creek, in the Wombat Ranges, so the police could not find them. On the 25 October 1878, at Stringybark Creek, they met four policemen who had been sent to arrest them. Three of the policemen were killed. Ned, Dan, Joe Byrne and Steve Hart were made outlaws, and turned to bank robbery.
With their mother in prison, and their brothers being hunted by the police, Kate Kelly and her sister Margaret looked after the younger children. Kate also helped trick the police, leading the police away when they got close to her brothers. She supplied the Kelly Gang with food, ammunition, and news about the police hunt. The folk song, "Ye Sons of Australia" has a part about Kate helping the Kelly Gang; 
The song places Kate Kelly at the siege at Glenrowan;
Historians now think that many of the actions thought to have been carried out by Kate, was really gang member Steve Hart in a dress.
Following Ned's arrest, Kate would often visit him in prison, as well as raising money for legal costs. She got people to sign petitions asking for mercy for Ned. Kate begged on her knees in front of the Governor, His Excellency the Marquis of Normanby, to save her brother's life. Ned was hanged on 11 November 1880.
On the night of the hanging, Kate and her brother Jim Kelly, went on stage at the Appollo Hall in Melbourne. People paid one shilling to see them sitting on the stage. Kate and Jim went to Sydney and continued to appear on stage, with Jim riding Ned Kelly's horse. The police stopped the shows. She was seen performing as "Ada" in a Sydney "Wild West Show", and then in Adelaide under the names Ada Hennessey and Kate Ambrose. She stopped performing due to ill health. She worked for a short time at "Hill Scott's Hotel" in Adelaide, before her poor health forced her to return home to Greta. She worked as a servant in Wangaratta, and a maid in Lanceby. 
On 25 November 1888, she married William Henry Foster, a blacksmith, and lived in the town of Forbes. They had six children, though three died when they were still babies.
On 6 October 1898, Kate was reported missing. She was found drowned eight days later, in a swamp near Forbes. Some historians think that she may have taken her own life because she had depression, brought on by the death of her sister, Maggie, two years earlier. She was buried in the Forbes Cemetery, aged 36.
After her death, her three children, Frederick Arthur, Gertrude Eileen Ada, and Ethel Maude, went to live with Ellen Kelly at Eleven Mile Creek. Frederick Arthur became a beekeeper in the town of Myrrhee and died in World War I. Gertrude married Arthur Cavanagh, a builder. They lived in Wangaratta and looked after Ellen Kelly in her old age. Ethel married Albert Hibbert, and also looked after Ellen Kelly.

Beta decay

In nuclear physics, beta decay is a type of radioactive decay where a beta particle (an electron or a positron) is made and sent away, or emitted. When it is an electron, it is called "beta minus", but when it is a positron, it's called a "beta plus". The weak force makes Beta decay possible.

<doc id="171227" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=171227" title="Beta particle">
Beta particle

Beta particles are electrons or positrons emitted by some radioactive nuclei such as potassium-40 or carbon-14 (which becomes nitrogen-14). The beta particles emitted are a form of ionizing radiation sometimes called beta rays. Henri Becquerel and Ernest Rutherford discovered beta rays in the 1890s. Beta particles are made by beta decay. When scientists write it in an equation, they are use the Greek letter beta (β). 
There are two forms of beta decay, β and β, which make the electron and the positron. β is a single electron that has a negative charge of -1. Both beta decays also turn a neutron into a proton.

Gravitational singularity

A gravitational singularity (sometimes called a spacetime singularity) is a term used to describe the center of a black hole where gravity is thought to approach infinity. 
In the center of each black hole is a singularity, a point where infinite density develops as spacetime approaches it. Spacetime goes toward infinite curvature and matter is crushed to infinite density under the pull of infinite gravity. At a singularity, space and time cease to exist as we know them and current laws of physics cannot be applied to this region.

<doc id="171231" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=171231" title="Supermassive black hole">
Supermassive black hole

A supermassive black hole is a black hole with a mass that is between 10 and 10 the mass of the sun. Scientists are confident that almost all galaxies, including the Milky Way, have supermassive black holes at their centers.
How supermassive black holes get started is not yet known. Astrophysicists agree that once a black hole is in place in the center of a galaxy, it can grow by attracting matter and by merging with other black holes. Formation of ordinary (star-sized) black holes from the deaths of the first stars has been extensively studied and supported by observations. 
However, there appears to be a gap between stellar-mass black holes, and supermassive black holes.
Stellar-mass black holes, formed from collapsing stars, range up to perhaps 33 solar masses. The minimal supermassive black hole is in the range of a hundred thousand solar masses. Between these extremes there appears to be few intermediate-mass black holes. Such a gap would suggest that the two types were formed by different processes. 
Observations show that quasars were much more frequent when the Universe was younger. Supermassive black holes of billions of solar masses had already formed when the Universe was less than one billion years old. This suggests that supermassive black holes arose very early in the Universe, inside the first massive galaxies.
Astronomers are confident that our own Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center. It is 26,000 light-years from the Solar System, in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. The region is called Sagittarius A*, and the evidence for its being a black hole is:
The Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, and the UCLA Galactic Center Group, have provided strong evidence that Sagittarius A* is the site of a supermassive black hole. This is based on data from the ESO, and the Keck telescope. Our galactic central black hole is calculated to have a mass of approximately 4.1 million solar masses, or about 8.2 × 10 kg.

<doc id="171232" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=171232" title="Event horizon">
Event horizon

"For the movie, see Event Horizon"
In general relativity, an event horizon is a part of a black hole. Imagine the black hole to be like a ball that you could see in a large spot of emptiness. The event horizon would then be an outer bubble that surrounds that ball. The space between the ball and the larger bubble would be the event horizon. If an object goes past the event horizon, it can never get away from it. Light that is emitted from the side of the event horizon near the black hole can never reach an observer on the other side. If an observer saw an object fall into a black hole, it would look like the object was stuck at the event horizon forever. The reason this happens is because of the gravity of the black hole slows down time around it, making it look like the object will take an infinite amount of time to reach it.

Chlorophytum comosum

The Spider Plant, Chlorophytum comosum, is a species of "Chlorophytum" native to South Africa.
Spider plants have long narrow leaves that are 20–40 cm (8–15 in) long and 5–20 mm (0.2–0.8 in) broad. They grow from a central rosette. It also produces branched stolons with small white flowers and baby plantlets.
It is a very popular houseplant. The most widely grown is the variegated cultivar 'Variegatum'. It has one or two broad yellowish-white bands running along the length of each leaf. Natural, entirely green plants are also grown. 
The Spider Plant is very easy to spread. They can be propagated by splitting its main rosette. It is even easier to remove plantlets from the stolons and plant them separately or put them in a glass of water. They will grow roots readily in water but establish faster in soil while still attached to the parent plant. Pinning the plantlet to the soil with a bent paper clip can be helpful. Make sure the soil is damp and well drained. The plantlet can then be removed from the parent plant in 7-10 days.
It is a very popular plant with beginners, as it is easy to grow and propagate.
Spider plants have also been shown to reduce indoor air pollution.
At the spot where a leaf would normally develop a node, these plants will produce adventitious roots down into the soil, and new above ground shoots.

Descendants of Charles II of England

The descendants of Charles II of England, Stuart monarch of the Kingdom of England, Kingdom of Scotland and Kingdom of Ireland, are numerous; lines of his many illegitimate children exist to this day. Though Charles's wife Catherine of Braganza was barren, he stayed with her but had numerous mistresses. Some of Charles's illegitimate children were born before his marriage. This article deals with the most senior figures who were descended from Charles' illegitimate male children; the names of his daughters are also mentioned. 
Although some of Charles' children made claims to the throne, most notably his first son James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, their illegitimacy meant that after Charles' death, his brother James, Duke of York became king instead. Over the years several of Charles' senior descendants have made names for themselves, including Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton who became Prime Minister of Great Britain, cricket pioneer Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, parliamentary reformer Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond.
Diana, Princess of Wales was descended from two of Charles' illegitimate sons; Henry Fitzroy, 1st Duke of Grafton and Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond. This means should her son Prince William, Duke of Cambridge take to the British throne as he is expected to, William would become the first blood descendant of Charles II to do so. Though William is part of the royal House of Windsor, rather than the House of Stuart.
Catherine Pegge and Charles II also had a daughter together called Catherine FitzCharles but she died young or became a nun.
Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland was perhaps the most notorious of Charles' mistresses. Some of the children claimed by Palmer as belonging to Charles are in doubt. Anne Lennard, Countess of Sussex was claimed to be Charles' and he recognised her, though some sources regard Roger Palmer as her father. Palmer claimed Lady Barbara FitzRoy was Charles' daughter, however he never recognised her and most sources consider John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough her likely father. Palmer and Charles had a daughter together Charlotte Lee, Countess of Lichfield and three sons who were recognised by Charles, their lines are featured below.
The two had one daughter; Lady Mary Tudor. Mary went on to marry Edward Radclyffe, 2nd Earl of Derwentwater; after Edward's death, she married Henry Graham, and upon his death she married James Rooke.

Athelbald of Wessex

Athelbald, also spelled Æthelbald or Ethelbald (–860) was a West Saxon nobleman. In 856 he was King of Wessex while his father was in Rome. When Athelwulf returned, Athelbald refused to step down. To avoid a civil war, Athelwulf gave his son the kingdom of Wessex and became sub-king of Kent.
Athelbald was the second of the five sons of King Athelwulf of Wessex and Osburga. She was the daughter of Oslac, Athelwulf's butler. He was born about 832. He is recording fighting alongside his father in 851 in the battle at Acleah. There the Vikings who had just defeated Berhtwulf of Mercia near London and when they moved into Surrey they were met and defeated by the West Saxons. In 855 his father Athelwulf went on a to Rome. He left the kingdom in the care of Athelbald. After spending a year in Rome and spending time at court of Charles the Bald, King of the West Franks, Athelwulf returned. But he had wed the king's young daughter, Judith. She could not have been any older than thirteen at the time. The Frankish king Charles had insisted that his daughter be queen. When Athelwulf returned to Wessex with his new Queen, Athelbald objected to his father remaining king. To avoid a civil war Athelwulf agreed to take the sub-kingship of Kent. He let Ethelbald retain his position as king of Wessex. Athelwulf died in 858 as the King of Kent. Athelbald then took his father's young wife Judith as his own wife, apparently without a major scandal.
Despite his marriage to his step-mother Judith, he had no children. He was succeeded by his brother Athelbert of Wessex.

Athelwulf of Wessex

Athelwulf, also spelled Æthelwulf or Ethelwulf (–858) was a West Saxon nobleman. He conquered the territories of Kent, Sussex and Essex for his father in 825. That same year he was appointed the king of Kent. In 839 he succeeded his father as King of Wessex.
Athelwulf was born . He was the oldest son of King Egbert of Wessex and his Frankish wife Redburga. He may have been born in Francia (France) while his father was in exile there. In 824 his father sent him at the head of an army into Kent. There Athelwulf drove Baldred, the Mercian puppet king, out of Kent. His father appointed Athelwulf King of Kent which included Essex, Surrey and Sussex. Athelwulf ruled as a sub-king of Wessex.
Athelwulf succeeded his father to the throne of Wessex in 839. His father Egbert had done everything he could so that his son would be king after him. He appointed Aethelwulf his sub-king; ruler of the subordinate kingdom of Kent. This gave Athelwulf experience that made him the leading candidate for king after his father. In turn, Athelwulf did the same for his sons to insure they would follow him to the throne. One of the first things he did as king was to appoint his son Athelstan, King of Kent.
Under Athelwulf's rule the ealdormen, the most important leaders after the king, became very important. In the 840s when viking raids became more frequent it was his ealdormen who led various local armies against the invaders. In 851 there were three large raids in southern England. The largest had over three hundred ships. They attacked at a place called Acleah in Surrey. Athelwolf and his son Athelbald met the Danes (vikings) in battle and defeated them. After this victory Athelwulf was considered the leading Anglo-Saxon king in England. In 852 Burghred of Mercia, a vassal king, asked for Athelwulf's help against Wales. Athelwulf did help and together they defeated Cyngen ap Cadell. Shortly afterward his daughter, Athelswith, became Burgred's wife and queen. By early 854 Athelwulf's wife, Osburgh, died. His eldest son Athelstan died about this same time.
In 855 Athelwulf went on a to Rome. He took his youngest son Alfred with him. He left the kingdom in the care of Athelbald, his second son. After spending a year in Rome he traveled to the court of Charles the Bald, King of the West Franks. There he spent the summer and fall of 856. In October 856 he wed the king's young daughter, Judith. She could not have been any older than thirteen at the time. The marriage was at best a diplomatic alliance. Both men were suffering from Viking attacks, and formed a common alliance. Charles insisted that his daughter be queen. When Athelwulf returned to Wessex there was opposition to his remaining king. To avoid a civil war he agreed to take the sub-kingship of Kent, held by Ethelbald. He let Ethelbald become king of Wessex. Athelwulf died in 858 as the King of Kent. Ethelbald took his father's young wife Judith as his own wife, apparently without a major scandal.

He was the third son of Ethelwulf of Wessex and Osburga. She was the daughter of Oslac, Athelwulf's butler. He got his first taste of kingship in 855 when he was left in charge of Kent while his father, King Athelwulf of Wessex, was in Rome. His brother Athelbald was left in charge of the West Saxon kingdom. When their father returned from Rome, Athelbald would not give up the throne. To avoid a civil war, their father Athelwulf took the subkingdom of Kent and Athelbald ruled as king of Wessex. When Athelwulf died in 858, Athelbert was once again appointed king of Kent.
When his brother Athelbald died in 860, Athelbert succeeded him as king of Wessex. Athelbert still had two younger brothers, Athelred and Alfred. But neither were appointed to fill the role of sub-king of Kent. Athelbert consolidated the kingdom of Kent into the kingdom of Wessex. During his reign Viking attacks grew more frequent. One Viking army advanced into Wessex as far as Winchester before being defeated. But the year 865 saw the arrival of the Great Heathen Army in East Anglia. This was a much larger army and would remain in England. For a time they were more interested in Northumbria. They gained control of York and moved south into Mercia then made their winter camp in Nottingham. Meanwhile, King Athelbert died in early 866. Since he died childless, he was succeeded by his brother Athelred.

Ticket of leave

A ticket of leave was an important document given to convicts who had been sent to Australia. Convicts who were well-behaved were given a ticket of leave. This gave them some rights, and they did not have to stay in gaol. With a ticket of leave, a convict was able to look for work in a particular area but could not leave the area without permission from a court. Every change of employer or district was written on the ticket.
Governor Philip Gidley King started the tickets of leave in 1801. It gave prisoners a reason to behave themselves. Also, it helped to provide cheap workers for farmers who were settling in Australia. The government saved money as it did not have to feed and clothe the prisoners.
Those with a ticket of leave were able to marry or to bring their families from Britain. They could buy land but not carry guns or get onto a ship. They were often made to pay back the cost of their travel in the prison ship to Australia. The ticket of leave had to be renewed every year, and those with one had to attend (where it could be checked they were still living in the area), and church services. Prisoners could lose their ticket and be sent back to prison if they were lazy, if they tried to get paid too much, or if they were rude to the police or soldiers. Sometimes, prisoners who helped the government, by capturing escaped convicts for example, might be given a ticket of leave as a reward.
A convict who kept to the conditions of his ticket of leave was given a conditional pardon after half of the time he was supposed to be in gaol. Then, they were no longer a convict and could do everything except leave the colony. Convicts who did not keep to the conditions of their ticket could be arrested without warning, go to court without being able to appeal, and lose all their property.
The ticket itself was a highly detailed document. It listed the convicts' number, the name, the ship in which sent to Australia, the year that they arrived, the captain of the ship, where they came from, their job, the crimes,the place and date of trial, the sentence, the birth date, what they looked like, the area the prisoner was allowed to live in, the court that gave out the ticket, the date the ticket was given, any other conditions of the ticket, and any changes of where they lived. A lot of this information has been kept, which makes them a very important source of information for people looking at family history.

John Joe O'Reilly was born at the Derries, Killeshandra, County Cavan. After early successes with St Patrick’s College and his club, Cornafean, he captained the Cavan team, which won All-Ireland Senior Football Championships in 1947 (at the New York Polo Grounds) and 1948, having also played on three losing sides in the final. He won 11 Ulster senior football medals, as Cavan took the title each year from 1937 until 1949, except two. He won a National Football League medal and four Railway Cup medals, in 1942 and 1943 (when he was the first ever Cavan captain), 1947 and as captain again in 1950. John Joe O'Reilly was one of only seven men to have had the honour of being presented with the Sam Maguire twice as captain. O'Reilly's father also played in goal for Cavan and his brother, Tom O’Reilly, played on the 1947 All-Ireland winning team and also won Railway Cup medals for Ulster in 1943 and 1944.
A Commandant in the army, John Joe O'Reilly died unexpectedly at the Curragh Military Hospital on November 22, 1952. He was named at centre half-back on the Gaelic Athletic Association's "Team of the Millennium" in 1999.

<doc id="171567" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=171567" title="Anal fissure">
Anal fissure

An anal fissure, or fissura ani, is a fissure (a small wound) in the skin around the anus. The symptoms are a sharp pain around the anus during defecation (for example, using a toilet) or by touching it, for example, while taking a shower. The small wound can sometimes bleed a little bit during or after defecation.
It's not completely clear what causes an anal fissure. It is possibly caused by constipation, too much strain on the anal sphincter (the circular muscle of the anus), reduced blood circulation, the skin is not made dry enough after taking a shower or swimming, the skin has been stretched too much, pregnancy, giving birth, and not changing a baby's diper in time. 
After the anal fissure closes, it takes 6 weeks to 3 months before the wound is healed completely. In this period the fissure easily opens again. Therefore, the wound can return repeatedly. 
A doctor can prescribe several products to treat the anal fissure. For example, a pain relieving ointment or suppository (an anal pill); a laxative (making it easier to go to the toilet); zinc-ointment (this will protect the skin and contract it, so it will heal faster). Further more a doctor can give advice about taking care of the wound and improve digestion and defecation.
If an anal fissure has become chronic and will not go away, medical surgery can be a solution. The circular muscle of the anus can be cut or stretched. Also an injection with botox can have a positive result.
The anal fissure can burst open very easily up to 3 months after healing, for example during defecation. The patient can do several things to reduce the chance that the fissure will return. The advice includes the following tips.
As long as the fissure is open (a painful, small wound next to the anus which can bleed a little) the patient can put an ointment with zinc oxide (protects and contracts) and pramocaïne (relieves pain and itching) on and around the fissure (in Europe available without prescription as Nestosyl). Use toilet paper or tissue paper to spread out the ointment and wash hands afterward with soap. This treatment has to be continued for several weeks to reduce the chance that the fissure will open again.
Besides it is very important to have a good digestion and defecation. The longer the faeces is in the intestine, the more liquid will be withdrawal. Because of this, the faeces will become harder and get more volume, and that gives more chance that the skin around the anus will crack again. Patients are advized to eat fibres every day (for example: unpolished rice, muesli, whole grain bread, dried apricots, figs, dates, prunes, saltless nuts, beans, peas, etc.); to eat the recommended amount of vegetables and fruit every day; to use a little bit of butter or oil every day; to drink enough during the day; and to exercise every day. The patient needs to avoid food that can cause constipation (possible: white bread, white pasta/pizza/noodles, eggs, cheese, sugar, coffee, chocolate, etc.). If necessary, one can take enzymes as food supplement with every meal that includes bread.
Patients should not postpone going to the toilet. While waiting, the faeces will push on the circular muscle of the anus, which causes a pressure. Besides the faeces can become harder and get more volume after a while. When the patient feels the urge to go to the toilet, the best thing is to go immediately. While sitting on the toilet, the patient has to press as little as possible, but instead relax the circular muscle.
As long as the wound is not healed, taking a daily bath with soda (sodium carbonate) can give relief. Further more that will keep the wound clean.
It's very important that the skin around the anus is completely dry before the patients gets dressed. The slightest moisture in the folding of the skin can be the reason that the skin will get damaged easily.
Some patients benefit by putting simple oil around the anus. For example, olive oil or sunflower oil. The skin softens and will not tear or crack as easily. Always remind hygiene.
If the tips that are mentioned above do not help enough and the fissure continues to crack open, the cause could be the use of toilet paper after defecation. The paper rubs too strong over the skin and causes the wound to open again. An easy solution to solve this problem is the use of baby ointment (zinc oxide ointment) that is used for a baby's red bottom. Put this, using toilet paper or tissue paper, before defecation around the anus. The skin will be more protected by wiping the anus and the fissure will not open again so easily. If necessary, the baby ointment can be applied again afterward. Furthermore, one can try to use another brand of softer toilet paper.
By following all mentioned tips and advice, always follow the normal principles of hygiene. Use toilet paper or tissue paper and wash the hands afterward.
These recommendations only make sense if the patient is sure that the problem is an anal fissure. If there is any doubt, especially when there is blood in the faeces, please consult a doctor.

Academic grading in Philippines

The Philippines has varied university grading systems. Most universities, particularly public institutions, follow the grade point system scale of 5.00 - 1.00, in which 1.00 is the highest grade and 5.00 is the lowest possible grade.
Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila also employ a specific grading category for retention. This system uses the General Weighted Average (GWA) per semester as a basis whether or not a particular student shall be retained at the course or college he or she is enrolled to. Some colleges have higher GWA requirement for retention, but most of them demands a GWA of at least 2.50 per semester. A few graduate schools, on the other hand, employ the "Pass" or "Fail" system.
Datamex Institute of College in Information Technology
Notable exceptions include De La Salle University & FEU-East Asia College, which follow the 1.000 - 4.000 grading system, which patterns those of American universities. This system uses the 4.0 grade point equivalence as the highest grade, while 0.0 grade point equivalence is considered the lowest possible grade. 0.0 grade point equivalence is considered a failing mark.
Other universities, such as the Ateneo de Manila University and its sister schools, use the letter grade system with varied grade equivalence range.
More importantly, Philippine universities do not have standard grade equivalence. Different universities have varied equivalence range, while passing grades are subject to imposed academic quality of an institution.

Dean (education)

In academic administration, a dean is a person with important authority over a specific academic unit, or over a specific area of concern, or both.
The term comes from the Latin "decanus", a leader of "ten," taken from the medieval monasteries (particularly those following the Cluniac Reforms) which were often extremely large, with hundreds of monks (the size of a small college campus). The monks were organized into groups of ten for administrative purposes, along the lines of military platoons, headed by a senior monk, the decanus.
The term was later used to describe the head of a community of priests, as the chapter of a cathedral, or a section of a diocese (a "deanery").
When the universities grew out of the cathedral and monastery schools, the title of dean was used for officials with various administrative duties.

The Juncaceae, the rush family, is a family of rather small plants that often look like a type of grass. They often grow on wet, infertile soils. There are about 400 species organised into eight genera. Juncus is the most well-known and largest genus in the Juncaceae family.
They are part of the monocot flowering plant families, which means that their seeds only have one leaf to start off new growth. 
Rushes are found all around the world. They are commonly found in wet marshy areas, as the plant prefers moist soil. However, seedlings can survive dormant once well established even in the driest of places. Seeds spread by water or birds and other animals. They can live for up to 50 years lying dormant in droughts.
Rushes is a basic food of many animal diets. They are also used as bedding and nesting material for many different types of birds and mammals. Rushes have been used throughout history by humans for various purposes such as weaving matts, medicine and animal feed. Today they are still used in some places for making sleeping mats but are mostly used as a decorative plant around ponds.

The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children

The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children are two sections that are in some Bibles inside chapter three of the Book of Daniel. These sections are sometimes called Additions to Daniel.
In chapter three of the Book of Daniel, King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon builds a statue from gold, and he tells everyone to worship it. Some Jews living in Babylon named Azariah, Hananiah, and Mishael refuse to worship the statue. The king gets mad so he has them put into a big furnace to kill them. An angel protects them from the fire, and the king decides to let them go.
That story is in all Hebrew and Christian Bibles. Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Bibles have a longer version of the story.
In the longer version of the story, Azariah's prayer is put after the three men are put into the furnace, starting at verse 24. In the prayer, Azariah says that he and the other people of Judah (part of ancient Israel) have sinned against God. He says that they are sorry and asks for God's protection.
The Song of the Three Holy Children is another part of the longer version of the Book of Daniel. It is sung by Azariah, Hananiah, and Daniel, who praise God and want everyone else to join them in prayer.

De Wahl's rule is a rule of word formation, developed by the linguist Edgar de Wahl and applied in a constructed language Occidental (known also as "Interlingue") created by him. It is useful to create certain grammatical forms from others (for example substantives from verbs).
Infinitives of verbs in the language Occidental have usually the ending -ar or -er. The root is obtained in the following manner: 
These six exceptions are: 
and the verbs formed from them with prefixes. 
Because the rule composes from three parts, it is often known as "three de Wahl's rules". 
One creates the substantives and adjectives by removing the endings and thus obtaining the root. After adding -r or -er, one obtains an infinitive in a majority of cases: "decora/t/ion, decora/t-, decora/r".
This rule was applied in the language Occidental. After a possible modification one can apply this rule to create new forms of a word especially in Romance languages or in languages which borrowed vocabulary from Romance languages.

Young's double-slit experiment

The double-slit experiment in quantum mechanics is an experiment devised by physicist Thomas Young. It shows how light has both a wave nature or characteristic and a particle nature or characteristic, and that these natures are inseparable. So light is said to have a dual wave-particle nature. The same is true of electrons and other quantum particles.
This experiment is very simple. It requires only a double slit device like the one in the picture, something to hold the double slit device still, and a good laser such as the kind that is used by workmen to "draw" straight lines when they are building. The laser is supported so it can only be moved on purpose. It is aimed at the center point between the two slits from a point about one half meter away. Something like a movie screen or a smooth white wall is put up on the other side of the double slit device several meters away. When everything is fixed, a pattern of light and dark bands will show up.
Lasers are devices that will produce one or more photons when given a certain amount of electricity. The photon or photons come out of a very small hole within a well known period of time. The speed of light is known, so the time the photons appear on the screen can be predicted. When photons are produced one at a time, what shows up on the screen are individual spots of light. If photons were waves then we would expect them to spread out as they travel and wash across a wide area of the screen, but that never happens. If photons were particles then we would expect them to appear at two points on the screen connected to the laser through the two slits in the middle. But that is not what happens either. When Thomas Young first did this experiment, he could only understand it by imagining light to be like waves of water. He thought that light waves moved out from the light source like waves spreading out from a pebble dropped into a pond, and that when the wave fronts hit the double slits, then the original wave gets through at the two slits and there are two different waves from then on. It was easy to figure out how two waves would interact to produce the bright bands and dark bands (often called "fringes") on the screen.
But there were big problems. Light did not show up at the screen as waves that washed across it. Light came to be understood as swarms of photons that individually hit the detection screen. And, very surprisingly, a single photon could interfere with itself as though it were a single wave that fit the old wave description. It split into two waves at the double-slit device, and they then combined at the screen.
The double-slit experiment became a classic thought experiment for its clear explanation of the central puzzles of quantum mechanics.
The double-slit experiment has been of great interest to philosophers, because the quantum mechanical behavior it shows has forced them to rethink their ideas about classical concepts such as:
Experience in the micro world of sub-atomic particles forces us to re-conceptualize some of our most ordinary ideas.
Moving picture showing how one series of waves hits a double slit and produces two series of waves that interfere with each other.

ZoneAlarm

ZoneAlarm is a software firewall originally developed by Zone Labs, which was acquired in March 2004 by Check Point. It includes an inbound intrusion detection system, as well as the ability to control which programs can create outbound connections—the latter not available in the Windows XP Service Pack 2 firewall. , the newest release is ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite 2009. ZoneAlarm was formerly known as Zone Labs, the usage of which is declining.
In ZoneAlarm, program access is controlled by way of "zones", into which all Computer networking connections are divided. The "trusted zone" generally includes the user's local area network and can share resources such as files and printers, while the "Internet zone" includes everything not in the trusted zone. The user can specify which "permissions" (trusted zone client, trusted zone server, Internet zone client, Internet zone server) to give to a program before it attempts to access the Internet (e.g. before running it for the first time) or, alternatively, ZoneAlarm will ask the user to give the program permission on its first access attempt.
"True Vector Internet Monitor", also known as "TrueVector Security Engine", is the core of ZoneAlarm. It is a Windows service which runs as "vsmon.exe" in the processes list. This Monitors internet traffic and generates alerts for disallowed access.
Operating System Firewall, OSFirewall for short, is a feature in ZoneAlarm paid versions only. This monitors programs and generates alerts when they perform suspicious behaviors.
SmartDefense Advisor is a service only available in premium versions of ZoneAlarm that helps the user with certain types of alerts. This utilizes a large database of trusted program signatures in order to provide the user with further advice upon requests from the program in regards to allowing or denying access to the Internet.
64-bit versions of the ZoneAlarm product line will be made available for Windows Vista in the first half of 2009.

Antivirus software

Antivirus software, if properly installed on a computer system, can prevent access to computer systems by unwanted computer programs. Viruses, worms or Trojan Horses can be used by criminals or mischievous people (called Crackers). They can be used to steal information or damage computer systems. If no antivirus software is installed, hackers may be able to access the information in the computer.
Most tests and experts claim that antivirus software is unable to prevent all attacks. There are many different types of antivirus software. Many Antivirus programs can be downloaded for free. These versions usually have some features missing. The missing features are only available to those who buy the "full" version.
Antivirus software uses many ways to protect the computer. They often search for signs of viruses in every website that is visited. Most also do a regular scan of all the data and files on the computer's hard disk.
Installing more than one antivirus is not a good idea. The 2 different antivirus software can interfere with each other.
Antivirus software can not always detect all viruses on a computer.
Sometimes antivirus software sees viruses in files that do not really have viruses. This is called a false positive. The antivirus software will sometimes remove files from the computer that should not be removed. This may cause other programs to not work properly.

Hello, is there some message for welcoming editors who do not speak English or speak only a little English? I recently left a message with one editor and I think in my haste I may have sounded rude. I think people should use mostly English here to facilitate communication, "but" I don't want to convey the impression that other languages are looked down upon. Because this is Simple English Wikipedia, we should be especially understanding of people who don't speak English well. Thank you. 15:44, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I've been wondering how we can encourage the adding of citations from for proper in pages? I've been wandering around the current pages and the vast majority of them are either entirely unsourced or vastly undersourced. As an encyclopedia this makes us practically unusable as a proper learning resource. As a doctor, I'd be struck off the register in no time if I relied on information that had no source backing it up. Many universities have out-right banned Wikipedia from being used by students as a source; and that's the enWP. What does the community think we can do to improve the situation? Cheers 22:06, 9 March 2009 (UTC)
What would people think of starting an image of the week? It could help hook readers into reading articles in a similar way to DYK?

Can anyone tell me the point of this Wikipedia having a while neither the PGA nor PVGA process even suggests editors look at it, leave alone try to comply with it? Some articles (e.g. currently Bastide) are being supported by a number of editors despite numerous problems with the MOS alone, not to mention the dozens of complex words still remaining in the article. I suggest we either try to use the MOS (by heavy suggestion in PGA and PVGA, compare en.wiki, FA has to comply with their MOS which is far stricter...) or we might as well not have one at all. () 18:38, 11 March 2009 (UTC)
(<-) To advance this idea the next logical step to me would seem to get a set of "manuals", to replace the current MOS.
Once both are in a state that we can make them into guidelines, we can talk about requiring their compliance for GA or VGA. But as stated above: the current manual is not in a state where we can require its compliance for the categories of articles mentioned before -- () 22:40, 11 March 2009 (UTC)

I'm sorry to say this, but this project has some real issues. I've just gone over the Knowledge groups on the Main page and almost all of the links contained therein have no (ie: ZERO) references to back up the information contained in them. We can not call ourselves an encyclopedia if we can't back up what we say. Without sources, we're not much better than a blog. I think we need to join together as a community and fix the problems with citations in this project. I propose that we start a focus group that contains all editors and that we have a blitz that firstly fixes all the links in Knowledge groups and then decides the focus that the community should have. No offence to anyone but page after page of stubs on rivers, asteroids, little non-notable towns and many other subjects are not going to keep us alive as a project. We have to focus on literature, science, medicine, social science, geography, history and other subjects our readers really need! As it stands at the moment, we are not usable as a knowledge resource to anyone. I've not done the research but I'd guess that less than 10% of our pages are properly sourced and that makes us next to useless as a reliable resource. We have to fix this. 
I hate to be so blunt, but we need to fix this site; and deep down, I think we all know this!

Hi there all. Today, I've started a new campaign to help improve the moral of the editors on this Wikipedia. It's called Today's User Ratings. Every day, I will select 5 users and rate them on a scale of 1 to 5 their usefulness towards this project. If you receive a high rating (4/5 stars), then I think you are very useful towards this project. If you receive a low rating (which shouldn't happen too often), I don't think you are that useful to this project. Most editors should be in the 3.5+ star range, so I hope you enjoy this :). I kind of mondelled it after Fairfield's Wikipedian of the day user subpage, so I hope you enjoy it :P. If you want to rate a user for a particular day, feel free to use the talk page of the userpage to propose a rating for a user. I will look through them and see if they are appropriate. Feel free to add your own ratings for the 5 users that are currently up. Cheers, 17:17, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

I'd like to propose template for official use. II made this template cause I "hate" going top and finding multiple changes of the same nature. This should help cut down on that.--  19:19, 14 March 2009 (UTC)
Personally I think this wiki is too overly concerned with flooding the recent edits page. I mean you can go back many hundreds of edits in the recent edits, so things won't be missed. And if they are its not the end of the world, someone will eventually notice. I mean the entire recent changes log on en.wiki fills up in one second...it takes forever for the full recent edits buffer to fill here. - () 22:48, 14 March 2009 (UTC)
A warning template is not the right way to go about this. Giving an established user a "warning" will obviously make these editors angry. If you must tell someone to get the flood flag, I would suggest telling them in a non-templated way to avoid drama. () () 01:45, 15 March 2009 (UTC)

Alexandre Guilmant

Alexandre Guilmant (born Boulogne-sur-Mer, 12 March 1837; died Meudon 29 March 1911) was a French organist and composer.
Alexandre Guilmant was born in Boulogne-sur-Mer. His father was an organist and organ builder, and gave young Alexandre lessons. Otherwise Alexandre was largely self-taught. He did study with Belgian teacher Jacques-Nicolas Lemmens, but by that time he was already a very good organist. From the 1860s he travelled widely in Europe, playing organs and becoming famous. Later he also visited the United States. In 1871 he became organist of the Trinité church in Paris. He kept this job until 1901.
Guilmant became well known in France as a teacher. Together with two other musicians, Charles Bordes and Vincent d’Indy, he started the Schola Cantorum, a private college where students could study music. He taught the organ there. Earlier he had succeeded Charles-Marie Widor as organ teacher at the Paris Conservatoire. His Conservatoire pupils included Joseph Bonnet, Nadia Boulanger and Marcel Dupré.
Guilmant did not just play the organ for church services. He became very famous for giving organ recitals. Often he played on organs which had been constructed by the brilliant organ builder Aristide Cavaillé-Coll. He helped to make these organs popular in France, and they were a very important influence on the way that organists composed music for their instrument. 
Both Guilmant and Widor produced large works for the organ which they called “symphonies”. These usually had at least four movements each, and gave the player opportunities to use many different sound effects. 
Guilmant wrote eight organ symphonies, as well as a symphony for organ and orchestra, and several shorter works for the same combination. He composed a great many miniatures, not just for organ but also for harmonium. This was useful for musicians in smaller churches which had a harmonium instead of a big organ. He wrote a book on how to play the organ, and for many years he edited collections of organ music which had been written by earlier composers.

Battle of Gettysburg

The Battle of Gettysburg (locally , with an "ss" sound), was fought July 1–3, 1863. The battle took place in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. It was the battle with the largest number of casualties in the American Civil War. Gettysburg is often called the war's turning point. Union Major General George G. Meade's Army of the Potomac stopped attacks by Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. This ended Lee's second invasion of the North. Lee began to move his men back to Virginia on July 4. Between 46,000 and 51,000 soldiers from both armies were casualties in the three-day battle. That November, a cemetery for those who died there was opened at the Gettysburg National Cemetery. President Abraham Lincoln gave a speech called the Gettysburg Address at the ceremony to open the cemetery and honor the dead soldiers on both sides.
Lee's army won an important battle at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863. Afterwards, he led his army north through the Shenandoah Valley. His plan was to start his second invasion of the North (called the Gettysburg Campaign). Lee had several objectives in mind. Lee hoped to force Northern politicians to give up the war by going as far as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the state capital. This, he hoped, would embarrass the Lincoln administration. At this point, Lee was playing politics. He knew that if he was successful in Pennsylvania it would encourage the Northern peace movement. He hoped it would get foreign recognition for the Confederacy. It could also force the Union to negotiate for peace, allowing the Confederate states to become an independent country. Lee badly needed supplies and intended to get them in Pennsylvania. In addition to being the state capital, Harrisburg was also the site of Camp Curtin, the largest training camp for Union soldiers. It was a major railroad center. More importantly it was a major supply depot and also a prisoner of war camp. 
Harrisburg, not Gettysburg, was Lee's intended target. 
In the North, Lincoln told Major General Joseph Hooker to have the Union army follow Lee's army. But Hooker was very reluctant to go after the Confederates. Finally, Lincoln lost all confidence in him. On June 28, three days before the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln appointed General Meade to replace Hooker.
Neither Lee nor Meade intended a battle take place at Gettysburg and neither were there when the battle started. On June 30, 1863, Confederate General Henry Heth had a division at Cashtown, Pennsylvania, Lee's gathering place before moving on to Harrisburg. Heth sent his division to nearby Gettysburg to look for, as he later wrote in his report, "army supplies (shoes especially), and return the same day." This started the myth that the Battle of Gettysburg started over shoes. Heth did this without scouting ahead to see what was at Gettysburg. The job of scouting belonged to the Confederate cavalry under J.E.B. Stuart. But they had been gone for over a week. So, blind to what was ahead of them, his soldiers ran directly into a Union cavalry division commanded by General John Buford. This started the fighting even though Heth and other commanders were under orders from Lee not to start a battle. But, as each side brought in more troops, it became a full-scale battle. Lee started moving much of his army there. One of his goals was to fight the Union army and destroy it. Now, he would have to do it at Gettysburg.
About 5.30 a.m. on the morning of July 1, the battle started. Heth probed ahead cautiously to a point about two miles west of Gettysburg. Buford's cavalry was deliberately slowing his progress. At about 10 a.m. the Union I Corps arrived commanded by General John F. Reynolds. They set themselves up along McPherson's Ridge to oppose Heth's Confederates. During the fighting Reynolds were killed but the Confederates were driven back. Meanwhile both sides brought up reinforcements. The Union set up defenses of the town with I Corps defending the western approaches with XI Corps to the north. The flanks were covered by Buford's cavalry. One Union division was held in reserve on Cemetery Ridge. In the afternoon, when Lee arrived, the Confederates still did not know the strength of the Union forces they were facing. They also had not scouted the terrain. One division of Ewell's Corps had attacked the Union I Corps just after noon. At about 2 p.m. Heth's division joined Ewell's troops in the attack on I Corps. At about 3 p.m., another of Ewell's Confederate divisions, commanded by General Jubal Early, attacked the flank of the Union XI Corps. By 4 p.m., both of the Union corps retreated through Gettysburg and took up positions on Cemetery Ridge. So far, the Union had lost about 9,000 men including about 3,000 who had been captured. The Confederates had lost about 6,500 men by this point. So the first day of battle was technically a Confederate victory numbers-wise. But Federal troops held the high ground as more reinforcements were still arriving. Based on the first day's fighting, Lee was convinced he could defeat Meade at Gettysburg.
Late in the day, Lee sent the famous order to Confederate General Richard S. Ewell to take cemetery ridge “if practicable.” While he had been awaiting orders from Lee, Ewell had ridden out to take a closer look at Cemetery Ridge. Based on what he saw and the confusing order, he decided it was not practicable to take the hill and set up camp. Instead, he decided to leave the assault for the next day. This was the first major mistake of the battle for South. The Army of the Potomac would end the day with around 21,900 men strongly positioned on Culp’s Hill and Cemetery Ridge. The Army of Northern Virginia would have around 27,000 men from Benner’s Hill to Seminary Ridge.
On the second day of battle, most of both armies had arrived. The Union line held the high ground in a defensive formation that looked like a fishhook. On July 2, Lee ordered General James Longstreet, commander of the Confederate I Corps, to attack the Union left flank as early in the day as possible. At the same time General A. P. Hill’s corps was to attack the Union center. General Ewell was to make diversionary attacks and "if practicable" attack the Union Army's right flank. Lee felt that if everything went according to his plan and the Union line was destroyed, the battle, and possibly the war, would be won on the second day. Lee's coordinated attack required getting all the infantry into position and moving up artillery to support them. Longstreet had the furthest to go and midway in their march realized the Union lines could see them. They went back and had to take a different route. Longstreet could not get his corps into position until about 4 p.m. when he began his attack. His attack on the Union line lasted for over three hours but could not break the Union line. Hill's Corps failed to be effective in the center. Ewell did not attack Cemetery Ridge as instructed in Lee's confusing order, but made some progress in taking Culp's Hill. 
Union Major General Daniel Sickles, a political general commanding III Corps, disobeyed Meade's orders and moved his troops forward to the Peach Orchard. He had been ordered to take up a position on Little Round Top connecting with Union forces on both his right and left. By doing this he left a large hole in the Union line. He marched to a position nearly in front of the Union line with no support on either side. Within an hour, his entire III Corps was nearly wiped out by Longstreet. Sickles was badly wounded by a cannonball and lost a leg. Being wounded was all that saved him from a court-martial. Sickles' blunder nearly lost the entire battle for the Union.
On the night of July 2, Longstreet’s largest division commanded by General George Pickett arrived and was placed in the center of the Confederate line. Lee’s plan for the next day was to attack on both the Union right and left, just as he had done the day before. Lee was still certain he could break the Union line and win the battle. That day Stuart's cavalry had caught up with Lee's army and Lee ordered Stuart to ride around the East side of Gettysburg and attack the Union rear. Ewell had also been reinforced and was ordered to take Culp's Hill the next morning.
Meade ordered the Union XII Corps to drive Ewell's forces off the captured trenches on Culp's Hill. They were to move at daylight the next morning. He was determined the remainder of the Union Army would hold its position and wait for Lee to attack.
Ewell began fighting on Culp's Hill at first light. Lee rode to Longstreet's headquarters only to find Longstreet had misunderstood his orders. He was planning a turning movement against the Union left. Now, with no hope of a coordinated attack, Lee changed the plan. Longstreet was to attack the Union center on Cemetery Ridge. Ewell's forces failed in their counterattacks and were forced to withdraw from Culp's Hill by about 11:00 a.m. Lee pinned all his hopes on Longstreet's attack on the center. Longstreet had the last fresh division in Lee's army. It was made up of three brigades, commanded by generals James L. Kemper, Richard B. Garnett, and Lewis A. Armistead, led by Pickett. 
First, a bombardment by about 140 Confederate cannons on the Union lines was ordered. The bombardment started about 1 p.m. About 80 Union cannons returned fire. The cannons duel lasted for between one and two hours, depending on the source (most say about an hour). The Confederate artillery chief, General Edward Porter Alexander, had only intended it to last for about 25 minutes. But he then realized it had done little damage to the Union line so he continued. But he also had to worry about running out of ammunition and not have enough to support the charge that was Pickett was about to make. When the Union guns fell silent, Porter thought he had knocked them out. But it was a trick by the Union artillery chief. His guns were waiting for the charge the Union forces knew was coming. Alexander sent word to Pickett he could start his attack.
The cannonade could be heard as far away as Philadelphia. The noise was so loud the gunner's ears bled. It was probably the loudest noise that had ever been heard on the North American continent up to that time. In the end the Confederate cannons may have killed as many as 200 Union soldiers in the area that would later become known as the "bloody angle". But the Union guns may have killed more Confederate troops.
Calling the Confederate attack on the Union center "Pickett's Charge" is misleading for two reasons. First, Pickett commanded only one of the three units in the assault. The other two were commanded by Major General Isaac R. Trimble and Brigadier General J. Johnston Pettigrew. Secondly, it was not a charge, which is a rapid advance towards the enemy, it was an attack which moved forward more slowly and over a longer distance. These Virginia units were joined by several smaller units of Confederates (some from North Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama) whose numbers had been reduced by the fighting over the first two days. When the cannons stopped, Pickett went to Longstreet to ask permission to begin the attack. Longstreet, sure the attack would fail, silently nodded his head and gave a wave of his hand. Longstreet had tried to get Lee to call off the attack, but Lee would not listen.
Over 12,000 Confederates stepped from the tree line and formed up for the long march forward. Waiting for them behind a low stone fence on Cemetery Ridge were about 5,000 Union troops, most of whom belonged to General Winfield Scott Hancock's II Corps. Depending on the source, this was between 2:00 and 3:0) p.m. As they marched forward across the distance, Union artillery killed large numbers of troops. Rifle fire from the Union line was intense. The Union troops used four lines of soldiers. As the line in front fired, they moved back to reload while the next line moved up to fire. Only a few hundred of the Virginians reached the Union line. Within minutes they were dead or dying. Some were captured. The attack lasted about an hour with over 7,000 Confederate soldiers killed. As the remaining Confederate troops retreated, Lee was seen riding his horse saying "this was all my fault". He then told Pickett to rally his division. Pickett famously replied, "General, I have no division."
At about the same time as the main attack, Stuart’s cavalry attacked the Union rear but the attack also failed.
Lee brought an army into Pennsylvania that numbered 75,054 men and lost 22,638 casualties or about 30% of his army. Meade lost so many field grade officers that the Army of the Potomac would not recover for the rest of the war. Both the Union I Corps and III Corps lost so many men they had to be combined with II Corps. The battle took more American lives than any other battle in United States history. Gettysburg is still the largest battle to ever be fought on American soil. The Union victory over the Confederacy ended Lee’s invasion of the north. Lee would never try to invade the Union again. The Army of Northern Virginia would never get their strength back. However the supplies taken during their time in Pennsylvania would keep the Confederate army going. The wagon train of supply wagons and ambulances for the wounded was over long. Lee never had more than 51,000 men the rest of the war. Numbers from the Union forces wore down Lee and his army. This is why Gettysburg is said to be the turning point of the American Civil War.
Meade was severely criticized for not counterattacking Lee after the third day of battle. The next day Meade sent out skirmishers, but did not attack. Lee had his army hold its position on Seminary Ridge all day on July 4th. The more than 10,000 wounded men would be moved by wagon train to Williamsport and cross the Potomac to Virginia. The rest of Lee's army followed on the night of July 4-5, screened by Jeb Stuart's cavalry. The next day, on discovering the Confederates had left the battlefield, the Union army cautiously followed. At the Battle of Falling Waters, Lee's army was waiting for the flooded Potomac River to go down so his army could cross. Meade's forces caught up with them there but the battle had no clear victor. The Battle of Falling Waters was the last battle in the Gettysburg Campaign.

Planetary nebula

A planetary nebula is a nebula that is made up of gas and plasma. They are made by certain types of stars when they die. They are named this because they look like planets through small optical telescopes. They do not last for very long compared to a star, only tens of thousands of years.
At the end of a normal-sized star's life, in the red giant phase, the outside layers of a star are disposed of. Because the outside is gone, the star shines brightly and is very hot. The ultraviolet radiation given off by the center of the star ionizes the gas and plasma that was thrown out from the star. This is what causes a planetary nebula to look like it does.
Planetary nebulae are very special objects because they can help make more stars. When a star dies, the metals that were in the core of the star are sent to other places in the universe. The only place that these metals form are in stars. This is called nucleosynthesis.
The pictures of these nebulae show that they have very weird shapes. Scientists are not sure why they are not all spheres. There are many theories about why they are not. They think that binary stars, stellar winds and magnetic fields might be part of the reason they look so special.
Planetary nebula are not very bright. None of them are bright enough to see without a telescope. The first one discovered was the Dumbbell Nebula. To early astronomers they looked like gas giants. This is why people called them 'planetary nebula'. We still call them this even though we know they are not planets.
Astronomers did not know what these objects were until the first spectroscopic experiments were done in the 1800's. William Huggins used a prism to look at galaxies. He noticed that they looked a lot like stars.
When he looked at the Cat's Eye Nebula, it did not look the same. He saw an emission line at a place that no one had seen before. This meant that it looked like an element that no one had ever seen before. Scientists thought it might be a new element. They decided to call it "nebulium".
Later, physicists showed that it is possible for gasses with a very low density to look like something else. It turned out that the gas they were looking at was oxygen, and not nebulium.
The stars in planetary nebulae are very hot. They are not very bright, though. This means that they must be very small. The only time that stars get that small is when they are dying. That means that they are one of the last steps in a star's death. Astronomers saw that all planetary nebula are expanding. This meant that they were caused by a star's outer layers being thrown into space at the end of its life.
Stars weighing more than 8 solar masses will supernova. Stars that weigh as much as the Sun will become planetary nebulae.
After billions of years, a star will run out of hydrogen. This makes the star colder, and makes the core smaller. The sun's core is about 15 million degrees Kelvin. When it runs out of hydrogen, the smaller core will cause it to rise to about 100 million degrees Kelvin.
The outer layers of the star grow a lot because of the heat of the core, and become much cooler. The star becomes a red giant. The core gets even smaller and hotter. When its reaches 100 million K, helium begins to fuse into carbon and oxygen. When this happens, the core stops shrinking. Helium burning soon forms a core of carbon and oxygen, with both a helium and a hydrogen shell surrounding it.
Because helium in fusion reactions is not very stable, the core starts to grow and shrink very quickly. This causes the gas and plasma in the outer layer of the star to move outwards. These gases form a cloud around the core of the star. As more and more of the gas moves away from the star, deeper and deeper layers at higher and higher temperatures are sent out. When the gas heats up to around 30,000 degrees kelvin, the gas starts to glow. The cloud has then become a planetary nebula.
We now know of about 3,000 of these nebulae in our galaxy, compared to 200 billion stars. Their very short lifetime compared to a star is why there are not that many compared to stars. They are found mostly in the plane of the Milky Way, and there are more and more the closer you get to the center of the Milky Way.
Only about twenty percent of planetary nebulae are spheres (like Abell 39). The rest of them have very weird shapes. The reason for all of these shapes is not understood, but it may be because of gravity with secondary stars if it is a binary star system. A second theory is that planets near the star might change how the nebula forms. A third theory is that magnetic fields cause the shapes. .
A big problem in studying planetary nebulae is that astronomers can not always figure out how far away they are. When they are close, astronomers use something called "expansion parallax" to figure out how far away they are, but this takes a long time. If they are not close, there is not a good way to figure out how far away they are yet.

Emission nebula

An emission nebula is a cloud of plasma emitting light in many colors. The glowing is caused by a star being near the nebula. There are many types of emission nebula. H II regions are caused when stars are forming and are very hot, causing the plasma to heat up. Planetary nebulae are made when where a dying star has thrown off its outer layers. This causes the core of the star to heat up the plasma.
A nebula's color depends on what chemicals are in it, and how ionized it is. Because most of the universe is made of hydrogen, many emission nebulae appear red. Hydrogen glows red when it is hot. If the nebula is very hot, other types of gas will be heated and the it might also glow blue and green. By looking at which colors are glowing in a nebula, one can figure out what it is made of.
Emission nebulae sometimes look like they have dark areas in them. This is because clouds of dust block the light when it is traveling between the nebula and the Earth.

Reflection nebula

In astronomy, a reflection nebula is a cloud of dust which reflects the light of a star or many stars. The light from the nearby stars is not hot enough to ionize the gas of the nebula to make an emission nebula. However, is enough to make the dust visible because the light reflects off of the dust. 
Reflection nebulae are usually blue because the scattering works better for blue light than red (this is the same reason that the sky is blue and sunsets are red).
Reflection nebulae and emission nebulae are usually seen together and sometimes are called 'diffuse nebulae'. A good example of this is the Orion nebula.
Reflection nebulae may also be the site of star formation.

Astronomical spectroscopy

Astronomical spectroscopy is the science of using spectroscopy to figure out what elements astronomical bodies, such as stars, planets and nebulae, are made of. It can also be used to work out how those objects are moving, using doppler shift.
The study of spectroscopy and spectra is used in astronomy to help scientists study the whole spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, which radiates from stars and other hot celestial objects. Spectroscopy can be used to find properties of distant stars and galaxies. It can find out their chemical composition, temperature, density, mass, distance, luminosity, and relative motion using doppler effect measurements.
Newton used a prism to split white light into a spectrum of color, and Fraunhofer's high-quality prisms allowed scientists to see dark lines of an unknown origin. 
It was not until the 1850s that Gustav Kirchoff and Robert Bunsen explained the dark lines. Hot solid objects produce light with a continuous spectrum, and hot gasses emit light at specific wavelengths. However, hot solid objects surrounded by cooler gasses show a near-continuous spectrum with "dark lines corresponding to the emission lines of the gasses". By comparing the absorption lines of the
Sun with emission spectra of known gasses, the chemical composition of stars can be discovered.

Luminosity

Luminosity is a measure of brightness. Brightness is how much light is given off.
In astronomy, the total amount of energy emitted by a star or other astronomical object is its luminosity. It is measured in joules per second, which are equal to watts. A watt is one unit of power. Just as a light bulb is measured in watts, the Sun can also be measured in watts. The sun gives off . This number is known as 1 sol, the symbol for which is formula_1. 
There are other ways to describe luminosity. The most common is apparent magnitude, which is how bright an object looks to an observer on Earth. It only applies to light, that is, visible wavelengths. Apparent magnitude is contrasted with absolute magnitude, which is an object's "intrinsic brightness" at visible wavelengths, irrespective of distance. The apparent magnitude is the less, for objects more than 32.6 light years away.
If it is necessary to talk about the total power output across all wavelengths, that is called bolometric magnitude.

Myopia

Myopia, also called near- or short-sightedness, is a problem with the focusing ability of the eye. It is when the eye is not able to focus properly on objects in the distance. This condition is very common and it often occurs with many members of the same family. It happens when the cornea becomes a different shape (too curved) from usual or when the eye is longer than normal and so causes light entering the eye to focus on a point within the eye before the retina. This causes the eye and brain to see the image of the distant object as a blurred image. People with myopia often squint while watching television or trying to see distant objects. Myopia can often be the first symptom of Type II Diabetes. 
It can be corrected by using glasses, contact lenses, or surgery. Myopia can also be corrected by practicing looking at distant objects.

Carbonation

Carbonation is the process of carbon dioxide dissolving in a liquid. For example, carbon dioxide is added to flavored water under pressure to make it "fizz" as a carbonated soft drink.
When rain passes through the atmosphere, it takes in or mixes with carbon dioxide, turning it into a weak carbonic acid. When the rain falls in limestone, it dissolves the calcium carbonate in the rock, turning it into calcium bicarbonate. This basically dissolves the rock. Holes and large cracks can form in the rock, which are called grikes, or in German ship docking "my name is jeff". The limestone that is left is called clint. In a large karst area which is a large area of limestone, there are a lot of big who doesnt like booty. If a stream or river passes through it, it could be swallowed up by a hole called a swallow hole. It can go through a series of underground caves and may appear on the surface again. An example of a karst area is the Burren, in County Clare, Ireland.
Carbon dioxide is weakly soluble in water, therefore it separates into a gas. The process of carbon dioxide bubbling out (effervescing) from a solution is represented by the following chemical reaction. This shows aqueous carbonic acid converts to carbon dioxide and water:
Carbonation also describes the incorporation of carbon dioxide into chemical compounds. Carbon-based life originates from a carbonation reaction that is most often catalysed by the enzyme RuBisCO. This carbonation process is so important that a significant fraction of leaf mass consists of this carbonating enzyme.

The vertices are where the lines begin and end. The points in Feynman diagrams where the lines meet represent two or more particles that happen to be at the same point in space at the same time. The "lines" in a Feynman diagram represent the probability amplitude for a particle to go from one place to another.
In Feynman diagrams, the particles are allowed to go both forward and backward in time. When a particle is going backward in time, it is called an antiparticle. The meeting points for the lines can also be interpreted forward or backwards in time, so that if a particle disappears into a meeting point, that means that the particle was either created or destroyed, depending on the direction in time that the particle came in from.
All the lines and vertices have an amplitude. When you multiply the probability amplitude for the lines, the amplitude for the particles to go from wherever they start to wherever they meet, and to the next meeting point, and so on, and also multiply by the amplitude for each meeting point, you get a number that tells you the total amplitude for the particles to do what the diagram says they do. If you add up all these probability amplitudes over all the possible meeting points, and over all the starting and ending points with an appropriate weight, you get the total probability amplitude for a collision in a particle accelerator, which tells you the total probability of these particles to bounce off one another in any particular direction.
Feynman diagrams are named after Richard Feynman, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics. His diagrams are very simple in the case of quantum electrodynamics (QED), where there are only two kinds of particles, electrons (little particles inside atoms) and photons (particles of light). In QED, the only thing that can happen is that an electron (or its antiparticle) can emit (or absorb) a photon, so there is only one building block for any collision. The probability amplitude for the emission is very simple—it has no real part, and the imaginary part is the "charge" of the electron.

Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse

Raymond VII of Saint-Gilles (July 1197 – 27 September 1249) was Count of Toulouse, Duke of Narbonne and Marquis of Provence from 1222 until his death.
He was the son of Raymond VI of Toulouse and Joan of England. During the Albigensian Crusade in May of 1216, he set out from Marseille and besieged Beaucaire, which he captured on August 24. He fought to get the county of Toulouse back from Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester and later Simon's son Amaury VI of Montfort.
When Raymond died, Alphonse became count of Toulouse, and after Alphonse's death the county was captured by France. Raymond VII was buried beside his mother Joan in Fontevrault Abbey.

Rival

A rival is a person or group of people who are trying to do the same thing as someone else, and trying to do it better. They are "competing" against one another. Usually they are about equally good.
Competing in this way is called rivalry.
Two (or more) businesses may be rivals. For example: they may be selling ice creams in the same area.
Brothers and sisters may be rivals. For example: they may both be trying to get their mother's attention.
Countries may be rivals. For example: they may be trying to have power over the same thing. This can be a dangerous thing which, in some cases, can lead to war.
In sport, two teams may be rivals. This is a more friendly kind of rivalry.

Since we use Simple English to essentially mean a subset of the English language and seeing how many pages that are on wikimediafoundation.org are written in standard and often complex English should we nominate an admin to obtain an account on WMF so that translations of current pages can be done into Simple English and then added to the WMF site?

Based on his history there, GFDL violations here, creation of a confirmed second account here (with GFDL violation) and our stance on banned users moving over to seWP, I considered a ban here also under the rule allowing an admin to ban and block banned users from other WMF projects who are banned or blocked on the project. However, I have given a notice on his outlining conditions for his being able to edit here in order to give him a chance to change and to move on.

It has been about a month or two since these two users have retired from this Wikipedia, and unless they have already requested it at Meta, I would like to formally propose that they be desysopped. Since neither of them has edited since they have retired about a month ago, I think it would be safe to assume that they aren't going to be coming back.

Hi there all. I would like to suggest a 6 month block of this range of users based upon the amount of vandalism that we have received from this range of IPs. Thanks, 16:31, 22 March 2009 (UTC)
Here is a link to the edits that have been made from this range:
As you can see from this page, about 95% of the edits from this range constitute vandalism, and about 50% of the edits made from this range have all been made in the past week or so. All of them have made pretty much the same kinds of edits, and most of them have either been blocked once already. Therefore, I think that this disruption constitutes a longer block than a few days.

Hello,
I think it would be a good idea to get a general idea on what exactly is a copyvio, before anyone deletes an article under G12, esp. those created based on the text of another Wikipedia. For this reason, I would like to suggest that no more deletions be done based on G12, esp. for texts from other Wikipedias.

I recommend that the Disney Vandal be blocked on sight. He also has a 68.220.* range and another one if I'm not mistaken (though I could be wrong). I think that blocking too many ranges may be harmful if done by someone who does not know what they're doing, so please consider (if this is a school, or if it may be shared, for example) the circumstances before blocking.

Bon Scott

Bon Scott (July 9, 1946 – February 19, 1980) was an Scottish-Australian singer-songwriter. He was the lead singer of hard rock band AC/DC from 1974 until he died of alcohol poisoning in 1980. 
Scott was born Kirriemuir, Scotland. He and his family moved to Fremantle, Australia in 1952. He left school when he was 15 and spent a short time in a juvenile institution. In 1964, he formed a band called The Spektors. They later became a different band called The Valentines. When the Valentines broke up in 1970, Scott joined a band called Fraternity. Fraternity left Australia and went to Europe, but came back soon after. Scott then joined a band called the Mount Lofty Rangers. In 1974 he had a motorcycle accident and was in hospital for a few months. After he left hospital he joined AC/DC. 
AC/DC's first two albums were "High Voltage" and "T.N.T.". They were only released in Australia. Their first worldwide album was released in 1976. It had songs from both "High Voltage" and "T.N.T.", and was also called "High Voltage". They released another album that year called "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap". Their next albums were "Let There Be Rock", "Powerage", and a live album called "If You Want Blood You've Got It". AC/DC's last album with Scott as their singer was "Highway to Hell".
Scott died of alcohol poisoning in London on 19 February 1980. He was 33 years old at the time. Brian Johnson became AC/DC's new lead singer. There is a bronze statue of Bon Scott in Fremantle. Shortly after his death, AC/DC released a tribute album to Scott, Back in Black.

Hubble Deep Field

The Hubble Deep Field, sometimes called the HDF, is an image of a small part of the night sky in the constellation Ursa Major that was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995.
It is important because it shows some of the farthest away galaxies ever seen, over 3000 in total.
The area of the sky the HDF was taken in makes up less than 1/10th the width of a full Moon, yet it contains over 3,000 galaxies.
Because of the time it takes for light from these galaxies to reach Earth, some in the picture look exactly as they did over 10 billion (10,000,000,000) years ago. Because of this it allows scientists to look at what the Universe was like at that time, and how it changed to become what it is now. Add to this, the cosmological principle, which suggests that on large scales the Universe is roughly the same no matter what direction you look, and the HDF becomes a very important tool for astronomers studying how the Universe has changed.
For these reasons the HDF is sometimes called 'the most important image ever taken'

Commitment scheme

In cryptography, a commitment scheme is a way for a someone to tell something to someone without letting other people know. Someone would do this to make sure they can prove who they are. Someone also might do this to make sure that someone does not cheat. 
This is done by using a one-way function to change a string into a hash. This is called the "commit phase". Later, if someone needs to prove that they were the one who made the commitment, then they can tell people the original string they used. This is called the "reveal phase".

One-way function

In cryptography, a one-way function is a function that is very simple to compute in one direction. There is a series of instructions that can be simply and easily applied to an input to give a complicated output. However the reverse of going from the output to the input is made to be as difficult as possible.

The SHA hash functions are cryptographic hash functions made by the National Security Agency (NSA) and the NIST. SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm. The three SHA algorithms are different and are called "SHA-0", "SHA-1", and "SHA-2". "SHA-2" uses one algorithm with different sized digests. The number of bits in the digest are put after 'SHA' in their names, like "SHA-224", "SHA-256", "SHA-384", and "SHA-512".

Power metal is a type of heavy metal music that mixes traditional metal with thrash metal or speed metal. There are two types of power metal. One comes from North America that sounds more like speed metal, and a more popular one from Europe (especially Finland, Germany, Italy, Scandinavia) and Japan that usually sounds happier and usually uses keyboards. It is usually characterized by high, clean, melodic vocals, fantasy based lyrics as well as complex and fast lead guitar solos.

An urban legend is an often circulated story that is not necessarily based on truth, but merely conjecture and rumor. However, there may or may not be a grain of truth from which the story originated. 
The Internet has made it easier for urban legends to spread, as people often spread them to their friends or family using e-mail. As a result, some websites such as Snopes.com and TruthOrFiction.com, among others, have been made that look at urban legends and try to see whether or not they are true.

It was about twice as large as Hurricane Andrew, which if Floyd struck Florida it could have caused even more damage than Andrew. Instead of striking Florida, Floyd struck North Carolina and caused flooding from North Carolina up to some states in New England. Floyd left $4.5 billion in damage from Florida to Maine. Floyd also killed about 76-86 people in the United States. One person was also killed in the Bahamas.

Hurricane Gert was the fourth of five major hurricanes in the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed on September 11 of the coast of Africa. It reached its greatest strength on September 15, when its winds were at 150 mph (240 km/h). It gradually curved northwest and then north, passing a short distance east of Burmuda. The hurricane's center did not make landfall, but it did cause many poweroutages.
On September 23, Gert became an extratropical storm as it turned northeast and became absorbed into another storm system. While it passed southeast of Atlantic Canada, strong waves hit Newfoundland which caused heavy marine damage.

Hurricane Lenny was the last major hurricane, hurricane, named storm and depression of the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. There are three main reasons to remember Lenny. One, it was strongest November Atlantic hurricane; two, the damage it caused in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and three, it moved the opposite way storms usually moved across the Caribbean Sea. Some people at the National Hurricane Center nicknamed it "Wrong Way Lenny". Lenny left $330 million in damage, this amount is likely not all the damage. This is because it was reported for U.S. territories only, such as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Because the damage was high and likely higher, the name Lenny was retired. In 2005 the name Lee was used instead. The name Lee in 2005 was not retired, so Lee is on the list for 2011.

Stockman

In Australia, a stockman is the name given to a person who looks after the livestock on large farms known as a station. Stations are owned by a or a grazing company. A stockman can also be the persons employed at abattoirs, feedlots, on live export ships or with stock and station agencies.
People who work on station, including stockmen, are also known as “station hands”. Men learning how to become station managers are known as "jackaroos", while women are known as "jillaroos". Girls are often stockmen on farms. Some stations are now making it easier for women to work on stations by building female living quarters and putting in machinery to do some of the heavy work.
A related job is that of the drover, who, like the shearer may be an temporary seasonal worker. Drovers are employed in looking after the livestock while they are travelling on a stock route. 
The word "stockman" was used in the United States and Canada as meaning a person who raised livestock, mainly cattle. The word "stockgrower" is used now. This meaning is very different from the Australian use of the word "stockman".

Riemann zeta function

In mathematics, the Riemann zeta function, is a prominent function of great significance in number theory. It is named after German mathematician Bernhard Riemann. It is so important because of its relation to the distribution of prime numbers. It also has applications in other areas such as physics, probability theory, and applied statistics.
When using mathematical symbols to describe the Riemann zeta function, instead of explaining it using English, it is explained like this:
"s" must be a complex number, meaning that it can involve the square root of -1, or "i".
However, because this doesn't work for numbers where R(s) < 1, Riemann used some very clever mathematics known as analytic continuation, so that it would work for every number except 1 (where the function just gives you infinity).
Leonhard Euler discovered the first results about this function in the eighteenth century. It is named after Bernhard Riemann, who wrote about it in the memoir "On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Quantity", published in 1859.
The Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture about the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Many mathematicians consider the Riemann hypothesis to be the most important unsolved problem in pure mathematics.

Dracaena sanderiana

Dracaena sanderiana, also called Ribbon Dracaena, Lucky Bamboo, Belgian Evergreen or sometimes Ribbon Plant, is a kind of "Dracaena". It comes from Cameroon in tropical west Africa. It is one of a group of small, shrubby plants with slender stems and flexible strap-shaped leaves. They grow as on the ground in rainforests as an upright shrub that can be up to 1.5 m tall. Its leaves are 15-25 cm long and 1.5-4 cm broad at the base. It is sold in the developed world as "Lucky Bamboo" often cited as being good for feng shui. This name is a misnomer however, as the plant is not related to bamboo. New plants come from short cuttings which are often kept in water.
"Dracaena sanderiana" and related plants are popular houseplants. There are many cultivars. The plant can survive in many indoor conditions, but indirect lighting is best. Direct sunlight can cause the leaves to turn yellow and burn.
Although it grows better in soil, it often is sold with the roots in water. The water should be completely changed every two weeks. The water should be bottled water, soft tap water with very little fluoride, or even water from a filtered, established aquarium. It does best in bright, indirect lighting and temperatures between 15 °C and 25 °C.
Pet stores often sell this plant in black plastic pots with slots in them. They say that it can live under the water. "Dracaena sanderiana" will only live for a few months under the water. It will start to rot unless the leaves are allowed to grow above the water's surface.
Yellow or brown leaf edges may be caused by too much direct light, crowded roots, or fluoridated or chlorinated water. Salty or softened water can also cause brown leaf edges. 
Twisted shapes are made by rotating the plant so that it bends towards the light. This is hard to do for many people, but patient people can make the plant take on new shapes.

Next up for the QandA interview is , lets see how he gets on...
I am a Computer Scientist (recently obtained Msc), currently looking for a job. When I feel like it, I edit Wikipedia; I think currently I am number 2 or number 3 (as to number of edits) on Simple.
I am generally interested in creating/improving articles that touch on Computer Science (and natural sciences, more generally); I have also been one of those who contributed to the GA and VGA processes; I was one of a few editors that initated their creation, and their improvement (about a year ago). I have contributed a few of those articles, or helped improve them to meet the standards.
Other than that I also often translate articles from other Wikipedias, Bastide was translated from French (currently up for GA, might fail though); Mumia was translated from the German one.
I have no idea any more... It was long ago, my first edits in SEWP were like end of 2005. The first message on my talk page dates from January 2006.
As to Simple English Wikpiedia in general: I am not a native English speaker; and I was enticed by the idea to make a learning resource to help other people learn the language (and to explain certain concepts in more simple terms).
At the moment, I think this Wikipedia has a small, but great community. It would not be what it is without this community; being small also means that we do not need many rules, this gives many liberties to those contributing.
I think at the moment we are growing only slowly; this means that we cannot put many ideas into practice, simply for lack of manpower.
Also what has become apparent with recent growth is that we are starting to see the first symptoms of "Drama", one of the reason why many people left the other (bigger) Wikipedias.
Our long-standing bureaucrat left for reasons unrelated to Wikipedia. To the others leaving: there have always been fluctuations in editors. I also think that the recent column in a web comic brought us editors; so it is not all negative.
I read mail; I check a few of my favorite web sites; thats about it. Offline: I sometimes go to parties and other events, and meet with real-life friends.
Not really; the issues that concern this Wikipedia are regularly up for discussion at simple talk; when it comes to resolving them, my opinion counts like that of anybody else... :)
Well thanks for that Eptalon! Look out for more QandA interviews in future editions!

Probable prime

In mathematics, particularly number theory, a probable prime is a whole number that is likely to be prime by having passed a probabilistic test such as Fermat's primality test. Probable primes may be composite, but the tests are designed so they are really unlikely to be composite. These probabilistic tests are easier to do than tests that actually guarantee primality, and the composite probable primes are useful too in encryption that uses prime numbers.

<doc id="172471" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=172471" title="Orbitron">
Orbitron

The Orbitron is a custom car built by Ed Roth. It was lost for many years until it was found again in Mexico in 2007. 
Built in 1964, the car ran with a 1955 or 1956 Chevrolet V8 and a Powerglide automatic transmission. The body was made by hand out of fiberglass. The driver sat in a cockpit set all the way to the back of the car. This was where racing drivers sat when they drove a drag racing car. It was lined with a funny-looking material called "fake fur" and it even had an 11" General Electric portable television in the console. On top of the cockpit was a top made of heavy, clear plastic. A top like this is called a "bubble top" since it looks like half of a soap bubble sitting on top of the driver. It raised up by itself with the push of a doorbell button on top of the hood. The hood raised by itself as well when a different button was pushed.
Roth built the frame himself out of box-shaped steel tubing. The engine came from one of his 1955 Chevrolets. He removed it so that he could put in a newer, larger V8 engine given to him by General Motors. The Orbitron was one of the very few cars which MRoth thought was a "mistake" after he built it. He was very proud of the shiny chrome work he did to the engines and frames of his cars; the Orbitron's engine and frame were covered by the body. The Orbitron was one of his few custom cars to even have a hood. It was said that the automatic hood did not fit well.
The Orbitron's most fun feature was its front end. It had three red, green and blue tinted headlamps. It was thought that combining the lights would make a white light; the idea came from color television.
Another car builder, Darryl Starbird, bought the Orbitron from Mr. Roth in 1967 for US$750.00. Mr. Starbird traded it to a man in Texas, but Mr. Starbird does not remember the man's name. From Texas the Orbitron was traded to a carnival owner in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico in 1991. By that time the special nose had been cut off and thrown away, possibly to help keep the engine cool as it was driven around the carnivals.
Michael Lightbourn, a man who restores old cars, heard that the Orbitron was in Ciudad Juárez. He discovered it parked in front of an adult bookstore where it was in very poor shape and was being used as a trash can. 
The car, which used to be painted blue, had been spray painted in black and was almost complete except for the hood, the television, the fur lining, the cut-off nose and the bubble top. The top had to be destroyed in the early 1970s when it became stuck and trapped someone inside. 
The family who owned the bookstore had also owned the carnival in which the car was used. After Mr. Lightbourn made a deal with the family, he was able to bring the Orbitron to the United States. It was then sold to Beau Boeckmann, the host of the TV show "Pimp My Ride." He fully restored the Orbitron in 100 days. He made it exactly like it was when it was new. All the original parts which could not be used and which Mr. Boeckmann removed from the car, including the frame which was too rusted to reuse, were stored away. Mr. Roth died in 2001, but Mr. Boeckmann was able to get help from men who helped design and build the car in 1964, including designer Ed "Newt" Newton and painter Larry Watson. The inside was redone by Joe Perez who did the original job.
The restoration even includes the same type of television. A small tape recorder and tape were found hidden in the cockpit. This was played when the car was new. It told people who were looking at the car what made it special and it still works today. Planet Plastics of Chino, California, the original company which made the bubble top, was asked to create a replacement. Little bits of the car's original "candy blue" color (similar to a very fancy color called "candy apple red") were found inside the car. They were used to match the color of the new paint. The original Chevrolet engine with its very special carburetors and Chevrolet Corvette aluminum valve covers has been rebuilt and put back in the Orbitron.
It is on the cover of the March 2009 edition of "Hot Rod Deluxe", a "retro" version of "Hot Rod Magazine".

It was officially announced on May 13, 1993 in IAUC 5789 with designation .
Nessus finishes one orbit around the Sun in 122.4 years, an eccentricity of 0.52 and an inclination to the ecliptic of 15.6 degrees. At perihelion (closest approach to the Sun), it moves closer to the Sun than Uranus, while at aphelion (farthest approach to the Sun) it goes even farther thanNeptune.
The orbits of centaurs change from time to time because of interactions with the giant planets. Nessus is thought to have a fairly long orbital half-life of about 4.9 Myr.

Helena Bonham Carter

Helena Bonham Carter CBE (born 26 May 1966) is an Oscar-nominated English actress. Bonham Carter made her first appearance on screen in the K.M. Peyton movie, "A Pattern of Roses", before appearing in her first starring role in "Lady Jane". She is known for playing Marla Singer in the movie "Fight Club", Bellatrix Lestrange in "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", and as Mrs. Lovett in "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street".
She has done many movies with her former boyfriend Tim Burton, including her roles as Mrs. Lovett in Sweeny Todd, and as the Corpse Bride in the movie "Corpse Bride" along with many others. She also played the evil Red Queen in Tim Burton's movie, "Alice in Wonderland" alongside Johnny Depp.
She was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to drama.
Helena Bonham Carter was born in Golders Green, London, England. 
Her mother, Elena, is a psychotherapist. Her father, Raymond Bonham Carter, was a banker and his maternal grandfather was H. H. Asquith, a former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Helena Bonham Carter's maternal grandfather, Eduardo Propper de Callejón, was half Spanish and half Jewish. Carter has two brothers: Edward and Thomas. She is a distant cousin of fellow actor, Crispin Bonham-Carter, who played Mr. Bingley in the BBC's production of Pride and Prejudice in 1995. Carter is related to Jane Bonham Carter, the Baroness of Yarnbury.
Carter attended the South Hampstead High School, a girls' school, in Hampstead, London. She later went to Westminster School near the Palace of Westminster. She was rejected from King's College, Cambridge University because they feared she would leave mid-year to follow her acting career. After the rejection, Carter decided to fully concentrate on acting instead of going to school. Carter speaks French fluently.
When Carter was five years old, her mother had a serious nervous breakdown, which took her three years to recover from. After recovery, Carter's mother decided to become a psychotherapist. Carter now pays her mother to read scripts and provide her opinion of the characters' psychological motivations. A few years after her mother's recovery, Carter's father became deaf in one ear while on holiday in Greece. He was diagnosed with acoustic neuroma, and underwent an operation to remove a benign tumor. However, the surgery went very wrong; after 9 hours in surgery, Raymond, at 50 years of age, had a stroke that left him half-paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair. With Carter's two older brothers away at college, she alone was left to help her mother deal with the new problems.
Bonham Carter has not received any formal training in acting. In 1979 she won a national writing contest and used the prize money to pay for her entry into the actors directory 'Spotlight'. She made her first appearance at the age of 16 in a television commercial. She also had a minor part in a TV movie, "A Pattern of Roses" in 1983. Her first starring role was in "Lady Jane" in 1984, which received mix reviews. She played the Queen of England when she was cast as Anne Boleyn in the ITV1 mini-series, "Henry VIII". She was restricted in acting since she was pregnant with her first child at the time of filming.
Her breakthrough performance was in "A Room with a View" in 1985, when she played Lucy Honeychurch. Carter also appeared in episodes of "Miami Vice" as Don Johnson's love interest during the 1986-87 season. She auditioned for the role of Nancy Spungen in "Sid and Nancy" in 1986, but lost the role to Chloe Webb. These early roles led her to be typecast as a "corset queen", and "English rose." She expanded her acting range in more recent movies like "Fight Club", "Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit", and in Tim Burton's "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", "Corpse Bride", "Big Fish", and "Sweeney Todd".
Bonham Carter played Bellatrix Lestrange in "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince", and "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" parts 1 and 2. She received good reviews as Lestrange, as she was described as a "shining but underused talent." She then played Mrs. Lovett in "Sweeney Todd", which was also released in 2007.
In May of 2006, Bonham Carter launched her own fashion line called, "The Pantaloonies," with swimwear designer Samantha Sage. The first collection is called "Bloomin' Bloomers" and is a Victorian style selection of camisoles, mop caps and bloomers. The two are now working on Pantaloonies customized jeans which Carter describes as "a kind of scrapbook on the bum."
Carter plans to return to the West End with an appearance in "Rubenstein's Kiss." However, the play was delayed because of her busy schedule. The production was set to open in November of 2004 but was postponed. In September 2008, "Wild Target" director, Johnathan Lynn, confirmed that Carter had dropped out of his movie due to filming difficulties. He then went on to say that she had joined the cast of Tim Burton's 2010 movie, "Alice in Wonderland", where she portrayed the Red Queen. In that movie, she starred with actors Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway, Christopher Lee, and Alan Rickman. Bonham Carter and Hathaway played two dueling sisters, the Red and White Queens.
In early 2009, Bonham Carter was named on of The Times newspaper's top 10 British Actresses of all-time. She appeared on the list with fellow British actresses Julie Andrews, Helen Mirren, Judi Dench, and Audrey Hepburn.
Bonham Carter played well-known author Enid Blyton in the BBC4 TV biography movie, "Enid", showing the author's life. This movie aired on 16 November 2009. Carter starred with Matthew Macfadyen and Denis Lawson.
In October of 2001, Bonham Carter began her current relationship with director Tim Burton. She met Burton while he was engaged to and living with actress Lisa Marie. Bonham Carter and Burton met while filming "Planet of the Apes". Burton tends to cast Bonham Carter in many of his movies. The couple lives in Belsize Park, London, England, in next-door houses with a hallway connecting the two homes. Each house is decorated to fit their own tastes and personality, because they felt the could not live 'together' but did not want to live apart.
They purchased the house when Bonham Carter became pregnant with the couple's first child, a son named Billy Ray Burton, who was born on October 4, 2003. The couple maintain a close relationship with actor Johnny Depp, who also regularly appears in Burton's movies. Depp is Billy Ray's godfather. At the age of 41, Bonham Carter gave birth to the couple's second child, a daughter named Nell Burton, who was born on December 15, 2007 in Central London. Bonham Carter says she named her daughter Nell after all the "Helens" in her family's past. 
In 2008, four of her relatives were killed in a safari bus crash in South Africa. She was given indefinite leave from filming "Terminator Salvation", and returned later to complete the rest of the filming. Also in 2008, Carter and Burton both put up their American apartments for sale. The apartments are located in the Greenwich Village in New York City. The apartments were sold for $8.75 million. 
In October of 2008, it was released that Bonham Carter had become a patron of the charity, "Action Duchenne" the national charity established to support parents and sufferers of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. She released the statement:
In December of 2008, Bonham Carter used her voice in a MTV domestic violence public service announcement (PSA), reciting a passage about love from the book of Corinthians in the Bible. The 60-second commercial features a troubled couple in a domestic environment. The commercial is silent except for Carter's voice and accompanying music. She recorded her voice in a single take for the ad, which aired on December 2, 2008 on MTV in the UK and Europe as a part of MTV's Staying Alive campaign. MTV will also make the ad available online, and is considering playing it in movie theaters. 
In early 2009, Bonham Carter joined fellow actors Ewan McGregor, Kate Winslet, Liam Neeson, Helen Mirren and others, in leaving an imprint of her lips on a card and signing it. The kiss prints, which were featured in the window of Newcastle's Fenwick store, will be auctioned off for a charity.

Parallax

Parallax is the perceived change in position of an object seen from two different places. 
In astronomy, annual parallax is the only direct way to measure distance to stars outside the solar system.
In essence, parallax is the phenomenon which occurs when an object is viewed from different positions.
It is measured by the angle between two lines of observation. Nearby objects have a larger parallax than more distant objects when observed from identical positions, so parallax can be used to determine distances.
Astronomers use the principle of parallax to measure distances to celestial objects including to the Moon, the Sun, and to stars beyond the Solar System. Here, the term "parallax" is the angle between two sight-lines to the star.
Astronomical measurement of position are taken at different times of the year. Since the Earth's orbit is known exactly, the distance from position 1 to position 2 can be worked out. Then, the angle from the horizon to the object can be measured precisely. This gives a triangle whose baseline and angles are known accurately. From the triangle, the distance is calculated by trigonometry.
The method only fails with objects which are so distant that the long axis of the earth's orbit is too short to get a sufficient difference in the measured angle. Astronomers have worked out various ways to get over this problem, though none are so accurate as the parallax method is for relatively nearby objects. This provides a basis for the cosmic distance ladder. This is the name for the techniques astronomers use to calculate distances further than the parallax method allows.
From 1989 to 1993 the Hipparcos satellite took measurements for over 100,000 nearby stars. 
Many animals, including humans, have two eyes which provide depth perception; this is called stereopsis. Because the two eyes are at different places on the head, this gives the basis for an automatic sense of distance. We perceive this as a normal 3-D scene.

The Fox and the Hound (book)

The Fox and the Hound is a 1967 book by Daniel Pratt Mannix IV. It is about the lives of two characters who are forced to be against each other, a hound named Copper and a fox named Tod. The book is Mannix's best-known work, and was later made into a movie of the same name from Walt Disney Productions.
The book follows Tod from his first contact with humans as a kit and Copper from his first encounter with Tod. They are living in a changing world; the wilderness present at the beginning of the book gradually gives way to a more urbanized setting, causing problems for Copper, his Master, and Tod.
It changes between Tod and Copper's point of view. Of the ten chapters in the book, four are from Copper's point of view and six are from Tod's. Both of the animals are presented as smart if not on a level with humans, and the book constantly emphasizes the point that both are creatures who rely on their sense of smell as much as humans rely on sight, particularly Copper.
Copper's chapters focus on his relationship with his Master as he assists him in hunting, primarily for Tod; Tod's actions kill the Master's favorite dog early in the novel. Tod's chapters focus on his life as a wild fox, avoiding death both natural and man-made while attempting to father pups. The book ends with the death of both main characters. Tod's lifeless pelt is hung and Copper is shot by his owner.

I'm somewhat new to Simple Wikipedia. I only started editing a couple of weeks ago, although, I've been active in the Wikimedia projects for longer. Firstly, let me say thank you all for being so welcoming. The difference between this project and the other one I was involved with is staggering; the welcoming I received here within the first couple of hours of editing was unimaginable, and I hope that keeps up. The friendliness of this project is incomparable, and that can be a make or break difference in keeping new users.
That being said, the reason I'm writing today is because of the question I put forward on the page. I asked if anyone was interested in started up the again. I was a big fan of the spoken articles when I was at the regular English Wikipedia. I love Wikipedia with every ounce of my soul, and even though I can't read Wikipedia when I'm out and about, I try to absorb it at every moment possible. When I came to Simple Wikipedia, one of my first destinations was to . I noticed, at the time, 18 articles present at that article.
Realistically, for a normal editor, that shouldn't be too much of a problem. The problem is, I go to the gym two hours a day. I work for the United States Air Force, and I'm not allowed to bring much to the gym with me besides an iPod. Because of that, I downloaded and converted .ogg files from Wikipedia to listen to at the gym while I worked out. Obviously, that was a problem from Simple Wikipedia. I downloaded one last night, and came back from the gym to review the changes I thought I could make to the article I had listened to. I'm 100% serious when I say that not a single sentence remained from the audio recording.
Because of this, I proposed a revival of the Spoken Article project. Beyond myself, it seemed that it would be supremely useful to the people we gear this project towards. Although a user may not understand written English, English in a verbal form may be completely useful to them.
When I was stationed in Rammstein, Germany, for the United States Air Force, I picked up a lot of German from the locals. That being said, I did not learn how to write German for a year or so after that. That seemed natural at the time; a person understanding a language in a verbal context seemed natural to me. A person learning a language in immersion will traditionatlly learn it from a verbal context primarily, and a written context secondarily.
With the tag in jest, from that experience, I have realized that a verbal foundation is fundamental to learning a language. I understand our obligation in providing a verbal context from which the wiki can grow, but we must face that facts. The grand majority of English speakers in the world can comprehend English as it is spoken far more capably than they can understand written English. However, I will admit that as a complete opinion. I hate positively, absolutely no evidence of that, I believe it to fundamentally true. I know that doesn't mean much to you citation searchers (a group of which I belong,) but I have no alternatives but to state it. I could find no references to a proportion on Google, or en.wikipedia.org, for that matter.
The lack of references don't detract from my point, however. All humans learn to speak before they read. I feel that remains true unless you are learning a language with no interaction with the people of the native language. That being said, it is necessary that we understand that English as Second Language learners are not the only people we are catering to.
My involvement in this wiki is questionable. I will readily admit that XKCD brought me permanently to this project, that was not prime motivation. I had heard about this project prior to the comic, it made me realize it was mainstream. For most native English speakers, I feel that wouldn't be an issue. For me, however, it was a huge issue.
My sister is autistic, which begets a responsibility to myself. I don't mention this in jest, nor in any sort of attention seeking. I mention it for elucidation to the rest of my explanation. The people who educate my sister are trying their best, but I do not trust her education in their hands. I know that she will likely never achieve the same level of contribution of an average person, but I feel that it is reasonable that I try my hardest to make her as contributory as possible to the mainstream.
With all of the previous points in mind, I proposed a revival of the Spoken article program. I figured that I could make a contribution in and of myself; I first proposed that I would read geisha. The fact of the matter is, I can not read that article. My Japanese is horrible, and I don't have the free time to improve it. With that inspiration, I realized that people who could pronounce and explain articles properly couple help not only my sister, but help everybody with limited/reduced knowledge of English.
Everything being said, no one expects anything out of anybody in this regard. Everybody helps Wikipedia in any way that they are able to. Those who edit one page are, in my opinion, as valuable as those of us who edit thousands of articles. Any edit that actually adds something to our knowledge-base is important; and doubly so if you notice it just browsing through articles. 
In the grand scheme of things, the Spoken article may seem like a minor issue. We edit Wikipedia all day thinking that what we're doing will help the users, and we're right. Every contribution contributes to our simple base of knowledge! We must consider, however, that we may not be helping every English learner/speaker.
That, my friends, is why I proposed restarted the Spoken article project. It isn't a deed of vanity, nor is it out of boredom. As sappy as it sounds, it is for my sister. I want her to have the best life I can mange, and Simple Wikipedia is a major hinge point in the equation. So, besides imploring all of you to contribute to the best of your ability, I want to thank you for your contributions. You are an important part of many people's lives, the least of which is my sister's.
Regardless if you decide to contribute to the spoken article project, I appreciate your contributions in any context. You are all incredible people, and I want you to think of yourselves that way. You help people beyond any other wikiproject I can think of. You help people learn a language that is usually necessary for their life. Of all the contributions I can think of, communication is the most necessary.
I know this article dragged on. It seems a little unnecessary to contribute it in the first place; all of you work your butts off without any sort of significant thanks, without provocation. I just wanted to say thank you, for me, my sister, and all of Wikipedia. In the immortal words of Simple Wikipedia's biggest fan, my sister:
Thank you people! I like what you do and I think it is really good!
-Cathryn S.
Thanks again all. () 19:18, 15 March 2009 (UTC)

Hello again. This time, I will be talking about writing articles here on the Simple English Wikipedia. 
Many people join Wikipedia because they think that it will be easy to write an article about a topic that they are interested in. However, that is simply not the case. When you write an article, most of the time, if the article doesn't already exist on the English Wikipedia, you actually will have to do some research. Writing an article for the Simple English Wikipedia where no page exists on the English Wikipedia is like writing a research paper. It is long, boring, and most of time a lot of work. Therefore, article writing isn't for the faint of heart.
Most people think that the process of writing an article isn't much work, but I can tell you from experience that that is just simply not the case. Some of the articles that I have written on the English Wikipedia have involved a lot of time spent looking for sources across the Internet. In fact, the exact process that I use for writing articles is as follows:
Most articles that I write from scratch take me several hours to write, and this is just for a short, 5-7 sentence stub. Now imagine if you had to write a 10-15 kilobyte article. Most people that I know who write these long articles spend several "days" writing them. So, to reiterate, article writing isn't for the faint of heart. 19:44, 15 March 2009 (UTC)

Gene Roddenberry

Eugene Wesley "Gene" Roddenberry (August 19, 1921 – October 24, 1991) was an American screenwriter and producer. He is best known as the creator of "Star Trek", an American sci-fi series. He was sometimes called the "Great Bird of the Galaxy" because he helped start Star Trek. He was one of the first people to have his ashes "buried" in space. 
Gene Roddenberry was born in El Paso, Texas in 1921. His parents were Eugene Edward Roddenberry and Caroline Glen. He grew up in Los Angeles, California, where his father worked in the police. He became interested in engineering and got a pilot's license. In 1941, he joined the United States Army Air Force. He flew many combat missions as a bomber pilot and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Medal. 
After he left the military, he became an airline pilot with Pan American World Airways. He then stopped flying in 1949 so he could write television shows. While writing he also worked in the police so he could provide for (look after) his family. In 1956, he quit his job as a policeman to write full time.
Roddenberry was married twice and had three children. He married Eileen Rexroat first, and they were married for 27 years. They had two daughters, Darlene (1947-1995) and Dawn (1953-). In the 1960s, he also started romantically seeing Nichelle Nichols and Majel Barrett (1932-2008). He divorced Rexroat and married Barrett in Japan in a traditional Shinto ceremony on August 6, 1969. They had a son, Eugene Wesley, Jr. Roddenberry's marriage to Barrett lasted until his death in 1991.
He died in 1991 of heart failure. He was 70 years old. In 1992, some of his ashes were sent into space on board the Space Shuttle Columbia. In 2012, some more of his ashes will be sent into space with his wife Majel's ashes.

Bavand dynasty

The Bavand dynasty (in Mazandarani: "Bävendiyun") was an Iranian dynasty that began in the early 7th century. Its rulers reigned for about 700 years over Tabaristan, on the southern shore of the Caspian Sea. The name of the dynasty comes from Bäv (also known as Farrukhzad), who ruled from 651 to 665. He was from the House of Ispahbudhan, a noble Parthian family which served the Sasanian Empire. The Bavandid rulers were originally Zoroastrian, but they later converted to Islam during the reign of Qarin I.
The Kayusiyya are named after Kawus, the son of the Sasanian ruler Kavadh I. It was founded by Bav (Farrukhzad), who repelled the Muslim Arabs from Tabaristan and ruled until he was murdered by the Karenid Valash in 665.

Next up for the QandA interview is , with guest interviewer . Lets see how he gets on...
Well I'm a Computer Systems Engineering student who is engaged, and I dont have kids :p I'm a produce assistant at Woolies :> 
I'm Steve, banned (at time of writing), I focus on solving other people's disputes (mediation mainly), the TV show 24, as well as other gnome work such as fixing redirects, wikilinks, citation cleanup, etc 
Well this discussion - In brief, I was banned for account sharing. 
I first found Wikipedia in 2005 or so but I didn't edit it till..er this edit. And yes, I had never edited before that. People were suspicious I was a sock of someone else cos I used an edit summary first up. But I'm just smart. 
You mean, what kept me waiting the 6 months, active in irc in #-en, editing other wikis, and vowing to return after the ban? 
I am needed. Some of the stuff I do, no one else cares about and there aren't enough experienced mediators/dispute resolutioners. I can help Wikipedia, and I have done so since editing Wikipedia, even since being banned, in varying degrees. 
Hahaha teh drama. *cough* The drama. The conflict. Users that are divisive and cause conflict.
Well, no, it doesn't help. I think what needs to change is we need to stop saying "NO" or "Oppose" to everything and start saying "Yes" or "Support". We can't be afraid of change. Change is generally good, and there's nothing wrong with trying something new. If it doesn't work, then we go back to how things used to be, but you will never know if you don't give it a go. 
Just wanna mention the fact that I know I let a lot of people down when I was banned at en. I just want to ask for the chance to earn their trust back, I guess. Gotta tie things off. And, to tell them that I haven't changed as an editor. I'll still be the formal guy I am now :p

Well thanks for that Steve! Look out for more QandA interviews in future editions!

<doc id="172829" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=172829" title="Glow fuel">
Glow fuel

Glow fuel is a term used to tell about fuel used for model airplanes, helicopters, cars and boats. Glow fuel can be burned by very simple two stroke engines or by four stroke engines. Engines like this provide lots of power in a small size.
Sometimes, glow fuel is called nitro or just model fuel. Some model fuel has only a little bit of nitro, but some fuel has none at all. It is called "FAI fuel." "FAI" stands for Fédération Aéronautique Internationale. They say that models used in racing or other competition under their rules may not have any nitro in their mix.
Glow fuel is mostly made of methanol, nitromethane and oil.
Methanol is the main ingredient. It provides most of the fuel's ability to burn. In order to burn the glow fuel, a glow engine must have a glow plug. The glow plug burns very hot as the engine runs because of a catalytic reaction with the methanol. Since the engines turn very fast, a phenomenon known as thermal inertia helps to keep the plug glowing as the engine runs. A small amount of electricity is used to cause the glow plug to glow as the engine is started. Once the engine is running, the electricity is disconnected. 
Nitromethane is added to the fuel for more power and to make the engine easier to tune. Nitromethane contains less energy than the same amount of methanol, but it requires less oxygen. This means that more of it can be put into an engine during each turn of the engine. This leads to more power.
Fuel for most model planes, boats and helicopters has 5% to 15% nitromethane. For use in race cars, the nitromethane can be from 30% to as much as 65%.
Nitromethane is hard to get in some countries since it is known as an explosive. In these countries, glow fuel sometimes has no nitromethane at all. 
Since the engine doesn't have its own supply of oil, it's instead added to the fuel to help lubricate the moving parts and to keep them from burning up. The oil can be castor oil or synthetic oils. Some fuels include a mixture of the two. The oils included in glow fuel are not burned by the engine. Instead, the oil comes out of the exhaust. Not only does the oil lubricate the moving parts, but the oil which comes out the engine helps carry away extra heat.
Glow engines should be run slightly "rich." This means that the mix of fuel and air going into the engine has to have a bit more fuel in it than it can burn at once. This unburned fuel and oil help keep the engine cool. After a model has been run, it is coated with a film of oil and must be cleaned. Ordinary window cleaner and a paper towel do a nice job of removing the oil. 
Glow fuel is not difficult to make, but some of the ingredients are dangerous in large amounts. Instead, most modelers buy their glow fuel already made. Some very small engines require more oil than larger engines. More oil may be needed in the fuel. The proper oil can be found at a hobby shop. Companies which make glow fuel mix their fuels with the help of computers. This helps each batch of fuel be of the highest quality it can be.

After the Edo Period, many became police. 
Ashigaru are noted for using surprise attacks and group tactics. They wore metal armor, a gauntlet, and a Japanese half-length coat. The armor also had leather and Japanese rice paper. Their weapon was a sword, spear, gun, or bow. Ashigaru also carried a water bottle, tissue paper, and rice. 
In the Ōnin War (1467-1477), the ashigaru robbed and looted Kyoto. This gave ashigaru a reputation as bad troops.

Genotype

The genotype is the genetic constitution of an organism, mainly its genome. The term is contrasted with the term phenotype, as follows:
The terms were invented by Wilhelm Johanssen to distinguish between inherited and environmentally produced variation. "The distinction was not new. It had, for instance, been discussed by Francis Galton as "nature" vs. "nurture".
The extent to which the genotype influences the phenotype varies hugely. "Some" aspects of the phenotype are almost entirely determined by heredity, such as eye colour and blood types. Human language is an interesting case. The "capacity" to learn and speak a language is entirely inherited, but "which" language is spoken is entirely learnt, and hence is environmental.

Austria national football team

Austria national football team is the national football team of Austria. It is controlled by the Austrian Football Association (German: Österreichischer Fußballbund - ÖFB).
The first official match took place on 12th October 1902 in Vienna when a team from Cisleithanien (Austrian part of the Austrian-Hungary Empire) played versus Hungary. (5:0) The team reached in the 1930s the best time. It was the time of the so-called "Wunderteam" (miracle team) when Austria was one of the leading teams in Europe. The Wunderteam was the first from the continent to defeat Scotland. In 1934 the team was took part in the FIFA world cup for the first time and reached the 4th place. 1936 Austria won the silver medal at the Olympic games in Berlin. Due to the occupation through Germany in 1938 there was no team between 1938 and 1945. The national team was dissolved and the players like Matthias Sindelar became part of the German team.
Soon after the end of the war the Austrian team played their first matches versus Hungary in Budapest. On December 6th, 1945 the first homematch took place in the renovated Praterstadion (now Ernst-Happel-Stadion). France was beaten by 4:1. Soon Austria was as successful as before the war. In 1951 Scotland was beaten in his own stadium by 1:0. Austria was the first team from the continent to do so. The FIFA World cup 1954 was the most successful ever. A legendary match was the quarterfinal against Switzerland which won Austria 7:5. It is still till today the Worldcup match with the most goals scored. Austria reached the semifinals and was beaten by the later world champion Germany by 1:6. The match for the 3rd place was won by 3:1 versus Uruguay. Players like Gerhard Hanappi, Walter Zeman and Ernst Ocwirk were playing in the FIFA world team. A 0:6 versus the Czech team marked the end of Austrias golden periode.
The next years Austria was an average team but surprised through notable wins. On was on 20 October 1965 when Austria won in England 3:2. Austria was the third team to do so. In the same year however Austria failed to qualify for the 1966 World Cup. Also the qualification for 1970 was a failure. The qualification for 1974 was missed after a 1:2 versus Sweden in a decider.
After 20 years Austria could qualify for the 1978 FIFA World Cup. The last match versus Turkey was won 1:0 through a goal by the later team coach Herbert Prohaska. In the tournament Austria won the groupstage. But after two lost matches versus Netherlands and Italy they failed to reach the final round. The last match was versus Germany in Cordoba. Austria won 3:2 through two goals by Hans Krankl and an own goal by Bertie Vogts. In Austria this is a legendary match. In the 1982 World Cup Austria also played. After two matches with wins versus Algeria and Chile a narrow loss against Germany was enough. Germany had to win to promote to the final round. The match ended 1:0 for Germany and especially in Algeria there were manipulation reproaches. After the 1982 Cup a lot of players ended their career, so Austria failed to reach the 1986 FIFA World Cup.
Under coach Josef Hickersberger Austria could qualify for the 1990 World Cup. He called back old players like Herbert Prohaska and mixed them with new players like Andreas Herzog who had only three league matches played before the Championship. After losses versus Italy and Czechoslovakia and a win versus USA they failed in the first round.
Shortly after the World Cup Hickersberger resigned after a 0:1 versus the Faroe Islands in Landskrona, Sweden. On the islands there was no stadium with grass and all the players were pure amateurs. This match was a great disgrace for Austrians team.
The last appearance of an Austrian team in a World Cup tournament was 1998 in France. Austria failed in the qualifing round versus Italy, Chile and Cameroon. As host Austria was qualified for the UEFA Euro 2008 and played versus Poland, Croatia and Germany. After losses versus Germany and Croatia and a draw versus Poland Austria could not qualify for the quarter finals.
Austria failed to qualify for the World Cup 2006 and 2010 and also for the UEFA Euro 2012.

Only when Celtic Park hosted the first Euro 2008 qualification match against the Faroe Islands. Celtic Park was used because the fixtures were decided by a random draw and Hampden had already been booked for a Robbie Williams concert on the same date.

Angels & Demons is a book by American author Dan Brown. This book follows the story of Robert Langdon, the professor who studies about mysterious codes and ancient societies.
The main subject of the book is how Robert Langdon, with the help of the beautiful scientist Vittoria Vetra, search for the container of a dangerous substance named antimatter that would destroy the Vatican city at midnight, and rescue the four cardinals in the day of the Conclave. To find the container and rescue the cardinals, Langdon and Vittoria have to follow the "Path of Illumination", that is marked by sculptures made by a member of illuminati - Bernini, each of them representing one of the elements of science, Earth, Air, Fire and Water. In the end they are able to rescue only 1 cardinal and the antimatter is lifted into the sky where it explodes harmlessly.

Antikythera mechanism

The Antikythera mechanism is an mechanical calculator. It is also described as the first mechanical computer. It was discovered in 1901 in a shipwreck off the coast of Antikythera, Greece. A number of gears worked together, much like they do in a mechanical clock. Using a model, it was found that the device could be use to show the motions of the sun, the moon and probably some of the planets. This makes it possible to use the device as a calendar. There were three big dials, and three small ones. Used as a calendar the main functions were:
The device was found on a shipwreck, near the island Antikythera, between the Peloponnese and Crete. Different coins were also found on the wreck. There are coins from Pergamon, dating between 86BC and 67 BC, and coins from Ephesus, dating between 70 BC and 60 BC. This means that the ship sunk between 70 and 60 BC. This device is the most complex device known in Antiquity. Only in the 14th century did people have the knowledge to build similar devices. 
The device is now on display in the Bronze Collection of the National Archaeological Museum of Athens.
When the mechanism was found, it consisted of corroded metal plates. Before x-rays could be used to show what was "inside", it was very difficult to judge what the mechanism did. Many of the parts that make up the mechanism were lost either during the roughly 2000 years it had laid on the sea floor, or shortly after discovery. Many gears have not "survived" in one piece. None of the scales is complete, and only one indicator survived as a fragment. The Antikythera Research project has produced a reconstruction; it added seven gears that were probably part of the device. There are 35 gears, and seven displays. There are many hints that the device was also used to calculate and show the movement of stars, even though none of the necessary gears or displays have been found.
There were 82 parts in total. With the parts found it is not possible to get the mechanism with all displays and dials fully operational. It is also not possible to know how many parts have been lost. In total, 30 gears were found. One gear is probably part of a planetary display, that has been lost. To make the reconstructed displays work, another eight gears would be necessary, but they have been lost. There are two crown gears, all the other gears found are normal gears (that require a special alignment of the axes). The gear was a primitive one, and the transmission was not uniform. The mechanism was repaired at least once, which shows that it must have been used often.

Bubblegum

Bubble gum is a popular type of candy that is not eaten, but instead chewed. Before being chewed bubble gum is hard. When it is chewed it is soft. It is called bubble gum, because once soft a person could create a bubble with the gum by blowing air into it. Bubble gum comes in many flavors.
Bubble gum is made with organic latex, a milky fluid produced by a variety of seed plants. Latex is also the principle component of rubber.
Bubble gum was invented in 1928 by Mr. Walter Diemer when he was doing something else. He only had pink food coloring. That is why most bubble gum is pink. His gum was called Double Bubble, which was the first bubble gum ever made. Bazooka was the second made bubble gum. Thomas Adams made a kind of bubble gum called Black Jack.
If you accidentally got gum on your hair, the least messy gum removal option using the ice cubes. Place several ice cubes in an ice pack or plastic bag and hold this on the gum. The gum should freeze and harden making it easy to break off and remove from hair.

Hay

Hay is grass and other plants that have been cut, dried and collected. It can then be stored in piles (called "hay stacks"), or tied into blocks called "bales". Bales can be round or box shaped (usually called square bales).
Hay is mostly used to feed animals. Some animals that eat hay are horses, cattle, goats, donkeys, and rabbits. Hay is fed when there is not enough pasture or rangeland on which an animal can graze or they can't graze year round. Farmers and ranchers often need to use hay in the winter when grass is not available.
Hay is different than straw. Hay is made from leafy grass and other plants (such as alfalfa) and is good for feeding animals. Straw comes from the stems of cereal grains, and is not very nutritious. Straw is normally used for bedding to keep animals warm and dry.

Hanukkah

Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday which celebrates the victory of the Maccabees over the larger Assyrian army. It also celebrates a miracle that happened during this time, where just a day's supply of oil allowed the menorah in the rededicated Temple in Jerusalem to remain lit for eight days. Therefore, Jewish people celebrate Hanukkah for eight days. Hanukkah begins on the 25th day of Kislev according to the Hebrew calendar. Hanukkah begins in late November or December. In 2013 it starts on November 27. The Hebrew word "" means re"dedication".
The "hanukiah" (or "hanukkah menorah") is an important Hanukkah candle holder. It has nine candles. Traditionally, one candle is separated from the rest, usually by being higher than the other eight. On the first night, only one candle is lit, on the right side of the hanukiah. On the second night, a second candle is added, and they are lit from right to left. This continues for all eight nights. The candles are never lit directly - instead, the higher candle, (called a "shamash", meaning "attendant") is lit first, and then used to light the rest of the candles. Before the candles are lit, blessings are said over them.
Jewish children often play a game called dreidel. The dreidel is a four-sided spinning top, each side having a Hebrew letter. The fire letters (nun, gimel, hey, shin) stand for the Hebrew phrase, "Nes gadol Haiya shaam," meaning, "A great miracle happened there." In Israel, by contrast, the dreidel reads "Po" instead of "shaam," meaning "here." So in Israel the phrase is, "a great miracle happened here."
Approximately 2,200 years ago, there was a war between the Greeks and the Jews. The Greeks won and forced their culture on the Jews. A group of Jewish people called the Maccabees revolted and liberated Jerusalem. The Maccabees found their Temple defiled. They sought to rededicate it to God, as the Greeks had been worshipping Zeus there. As part of the rededication, they needed to relight the menorah, whose source of fuel was olive oil.
According to the Talmud, the Jewish people only found a single jar of undefiled oil, and that oil was only enough to last a single day. The Jewish people took a leap of faith and relit the menorah. To their surprise, the menorah stayed lit for eight days, which was seven more days than they expected. The Jewish people attributed the surprising amount of time that the oil lasted to God (a miracle).
Hanukkah is an eight-day celebration, and each day commemorates each day that the oil lasted. On each day, a branch of the nine-branch Hanukkah menorah is lit with the "shamash" ("helper" candle), which sits on the middle branch.

Madrid Symphony Orchestra

The Madrid Symphony Orchestra () is an orchestra based in Madrid, the capital of Spain. It was started in 1903. 
The orchestra gave its first public concert under the conductor, Alonso Cordelás on 7 February 1904 at the Teatro Real. The next year Enrique Fernández Arbós became conductor of the orchestra, and he stayed with them for more than 30 years. The orchestra played a lot of Spanish music as well as music by composers from other European countries. Some very famous people such as Igor Stravinsky and Richard Strauss conducted the orchestra. The orchestra gave the first performances of famous pieces such as: Falla's "Nights in the Gardens of Spain" (1916) and Prokofiev's Second Violin Concerto (1935). 
During the Spanish Civil War it was difficult to keep the concerts going. After the war, in June 1939, Arbós died and many of the musicians had gone into exile because of the rise of the dictator General Francisco Franco. The conductor Enrique Jordá kept the orchestra going until 1945 when the World War II ended.
From 1958 the orchestra often played for comic Spanish operas called zarzuelas. They often travelled through Spain and to Portugal and Latin America giving concerts..
In 1965 a new orchestra, the Orquesta Sinfónica de RTVE, was started. This made things difficult for the Madrid Symphony Orchestra. They had to spend a lot of time playing for the Teatro de la Zarzuela. In the 1970s they made a lot of recordings of zarzuelas and Spanish operas. The recordings were very good, but they did not have much time for orchestral concerts.
After Franco’s death the orchestra became the official orchestra for the Teatro de la Zarzuela. Later, when a new concert hall, the Auditorio Nacional de Música was opened, the orchestra had more opportunity to give orchestra concerts. In 1997, the Orchestra moved out of the Teatro de la Zarzuela and moved to the Teatro Real where they will stay at least until 2009. The orchestra now have an educational plan to help young children listen to music and encourage them to play instruments.
Today the orchestra is conducted by Jesús López Cobos.

Cashew

The cashew is a tropical tree in the flowering plant. The plant is native to northeastern Brazil. It is now widely grown in tropical climates for its cashew nuts (see below) and cashew apples.
Cashew nuts are a popular snack and food source. Cashews, unlike other oily tree nuts, contain starch to about 10% of their weight. This makes them more effective than other nuts in thickening water-based dishes such as soups, meat stews, and some Indian milk-based desserts. Many southeast Asian and south Asian cuisines use cashews for this unusual characteristic, rather than other nuts.
Because the shell of the cashew nut is toxic, it is removed before it is sold to consumers.

HammerFall

HammerFall is a heavy metal/power metal band from Gothenburg, Sweden. The band was started in 1993 by the former guitarist of Ceremonial Oath, Oscar Dronjak.
HammerFall began when guitarist Oscar Dronjak quit Ceremonial Oath and invited Jesper Strömblad from In Flames to join him as a drummer on a new band he had been thinking about for a long time. Dronjak had already made the song "Steel Meets Steel", which was included on HammerFall's first album. They were later joined by guitarist Niklas Sundin, bassist Johann Larsson and vocalist Mikael Stanne. When Niklas Sundin and Johann Larsson left HammerFall the next year, Glenn Ljungström and Fredrik Larsson replaced them.
Both Dronjak and Strömblad were in other bands: Dronjak was in "Crystal Age", Strömblad was in In Flames. Because of this, HammerFall was not very active during this time. The only concert they played was a local music contest called "Rockslaget". The band hadn't written many songs yet, and usually only played covers of bands like Pretty Maids, Judas Priest and Alice Cooper.
In 1996, HammerFall was playing in "Rockslaget". They found out Mikael Stanne was not going to be able to perform with the band. Because of this, they started looking for a new singer. They got in contact with Joacim Cans, who agreed to play with them for the night. By the end of that day, Joacim had already been made an official member of the band.
To try to get a record deal, HammerFall recorded a live concert and sent it to the Dutch label, Vic Records. The band got an offer, and spent the rest of the year recording "Glory to the Brave". The album was released in the Netherlands first and did pretty well.
As HammerFall became more famous, some of the band members needed to leave because they were already in other bands. To fill the empty musical spots, Stefan Elmgren assumed the lead guitar and Patrik Räfling assumed the drums and Fredrik decided to remain in the band until a suitable replacement for him was found. In May of 1997, bassist Magnus Rosén joined the band. Stefan Elmgren played some of the guitars on the "Glory to the Brave" album (such as the acoustic guitars on "I Believe") and Patrik Räfling actually played the drums on all songs in place of Jesper, but only as a guest performers, not members of the band.
In early 1997, German label Nuclear Blast approached HammerFall with a contract for a European release of four albums. The deal was accepted and the band recorded two music videos "HammerFall" and "Glory to the Brave". After the release of a promotional single, "Glory to the Brave" was released in Europe. 
They did their first tours in Europe with Gamma Ray, Jag Panzer, Lake of Tears and Raven.
Near the end of 2007, "Glory to the Brave" was released in Japan and the United States. They sold over 100,000 copies of the album.
In February 1998, they began recording "Legacy of Kings". This album was made by Joacim, Oscar, and Jesper. Jesper had already quit the band, but wanted to help with the album. The album was produced by Fredrik Nordström (from Dream Evil) and Oscar, with the help of Joacim. It took the band one and a half months to record the album.
Before releasing the album, they toured with Alice Cooper, Rammstein, Deep Purple, Dream Theater, Saxon and Stratovarius. On the tour, they played the Beach Boys album "Wild Honey" in its entirety.
Their first world tour was in October 1998. During the shows in Sweden, Joacim Cans caught a serious throat infection, and he could not sing. Magnus Rosén also caught the infection, and after him, all of HammerFall's support crew became sick. The band played for as long as possible and then were had to cancel some of their concerts. 
After the tour, Anders Johansson, a friend of Magnus Rosén, joined as the new drummer.
After many concerts, the band went back to Sweden and began writing songs for their next album. It took eight weeks to record, and they named it "Renegade". A music video by director Roger Johansson was created for the Renegade, and it reached the top of the Swedish charts; then the album also reached the top of the charts.
The band's second world tour started in January 2001. 
After the tour, HammerFall recorded their fourth album "Crimson Thunder".
While Joacim was at a rock club he had been frequenting for over a decade, he was attacked by an person who hit him in the head with a beer glass and ran away. Joacim had to be taken to a hospital, where he had plastic surgery and rested for a couple of days. 
HammerFall toured after the release of the album. The tour was stopped when Oscar Dronjak had a motorcycle accident, breaking his left arm. HammerFall took a break because of this. Stefan decided to start flying airplanes, Magnus and Anders worked with other bands, and Joacim started on his own project. Joacim also had his first child.
Oscar worked with a team of doctors to get healthy again. After recovering, he toured with HammerFall again.
Their live album and DVD, "One Crimson Night", was released in February 2003. After this, they decided to take a break. Two years later, the band released "". A video for the song "Blood Bound" was made by director Roger Johansson.
On October 20, 2006, HammerFall released "Threshold".
On March 6, 2007, Magnus Rosén left the band. He said he didn't like being in HammerFall because the bass parts of the song were too easy to play, and wanted more of a challenge.
On April 2, 2008 Stefan Elmgren decided to leave HammerFall so he could become and airplane pilot. Pontus Norgren from The Poodles took over guitar in the band. 
HammerFall's latest album, No Sacrifice, No Victory, was released February 23, 2009.

<doc id="173399" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=173399" title="Paper clip">
Paper clip

A paper clip (or sometimes paperclip) is a piece of plastic or metal that is used to hold pieces of paper together.
A paper clip is usually a thin wire in a shape that is wrapped in on itself. It is used to hold two or more pieces of paper together by pressure. Some other kinds of paper clips use two pieces.
The type of wire paper clip that is usually used was never patented. It was first made by The Gem Manufacturing Company sometime during the 1890s. The first time Gem was mentioned was in 1883, but historians do not think this is when they began making paper clips. The first advertisement for paper clips was in August 1894. The "Gem" name was trademarked in the United States in 1904. The trademark paperwork said that the paper clip had been sold since March 1892.
It has been said that Herbert Spencer invented the paper clip.
It is proven that the paper clip was well known by 1899. A patent was given that year for a "machine to make wire paper clips" to William Middlebrook on April 27. The drawing in the patent shows a Gem paper clip. There are many different kinds of paper clips. Some have ends instead of round ones. Some have a bent end. This was done so that it is easier to put paper in. Some of them have wires with bumps that allow them to hold the paper better. Some paper clips are made to look good. They are sometimes in a triangle or a circle.
A Norwegian, Johan Vaaler (1866–1910), has sometimes been called the inventor of the paper clip. He was given patents in Germany and in the United States for a paper clip of a different design 
After Vaaler died, some Norwegians made a myth that the paper clip was invented by a Norwegian genius. Dictionaries since the 1950s have said that Vaaler is the inventor of the paper clip. Dictionaries in other countries sometimes say this now too.
Vaaler was probably given a patent in other countries because patent laws in the 1800s were not as tough as they are today. Vaaler worked in a patent office, or place that deals with patents, and could have given himself a patent very easily.
The patents that Vaaler held have since expired. The Gem paper clip was used around the world, including in Norway. His device did not work as well as the Gem version. This was because it was hard to put pieces of paper in it, and it did not look as good when there was paper in it. 
The person who started the Norwegian paper clip myth was a person who worked for Norway's patent office. He visited Germany in the 1920s to get patents for some Norwegian inventions. He came across Vaaler's patent, and did not realize that it was not the same as the Gem paper clip. In a pamphlet put out by the patent office in celebration of its first 50 years, he wrote about how Vaaler was the inventor of the paper clip. This was put into many Norwegian encyclopedias after World War II.
The war helped make the paper clip into a national symbol. Some Norwegian patriots wore them on the outside of their clothing as a symbol of resistance to the German occupiers and local Nazi rulers when they were not allowed to protest. Soon, the Nazi's made wearing them illegal. 
The first Norwegian encyclopedia did mention it as a symbol of resistance, but did not call it a Norwegian invention. According to the encyclopedia, the idea started in France.
After the war, Norway believed the paper clip was a national symbol. Authors of books on the history of Norwegian technology used its status to make their stories bigger. The did not mention that Vaaler's clip was not the same as the Gem clip. In 1989, a big paper clip, almost 7 meters tall was put up in a college near Oslo in honor of Vaaler. The monument is a Gem paper clip, and not the one that was patented by Vaaler. In 1999, 100 years after the German patent was accepted, Norway celebrated by making a postage stamp that had a paper clip on it. However, it was once again the Gem paper clip in the stamp. In 2005, there was a Norwegian biography written about Johan Vaaler, 'The inventor of the paper clip.'
Paper clips are usually made out of wire. A paper clip can be useful when working with many things, like computers. The metal wire can be made straight with a little bit of work. Some things have buttons that cannot be reached by fingers if the people who make the device do not want users pressing them accidentally. Most CD-ROM drives have small buttons like this to eject the CD-ROM if there is not any power. A paper clip bent into a 'U' shape can be used to create a short circuit to start a computer if there is no power button.
Kyle MacDonald took one red paperclip and traded it for a house. He began with a red paper clip and posted it on craigslist, trading it for a pen. MacDonald kept trading things until he finally traded a movie role for a two-story house in Kipling, Saskatchewan.
Paper clips can be used to pick a lock. Usually, professional lock picking tools are used, because most paper clips are not strong enough for this use.

Cryonics

Cryonics is when people (or animals) are made very cold after a doctor says they are dead. When they are warmed again there might still be a cure for them because of better medicine that can be invented in the future.
Cold people like this are not awake at all as they have no brain activity. The law also says they are dead. Their body and its brain are made more like glass than ice because ice would harm their cells more. To do this, their blood is replaced with chemicals called "cryoprotectants", which act like anti-freeze.
Making them cold can stop cells from dying but can kill many of them. Cryonics is not allowed unless you are already declared dead by law because this damage would make you dead by law. To be dead in that way means you cannot live with help from medicine we have today. The idea of people who do cryonics is that better medicine from tomorrow may be used for a cryonics patient, so the person may be alive in a different sense than the law uses today.
Cryonics is justified by three facts that are not well known:
Cryonics should work, even though it cannot be demonstrated to work today. That is, the scientific justification for cryonics. It is a justification that grows stronger with every new advance in preservation technology.

I don't mean this to be cheesy or self centered, but I just wanted the time to say thank you and good bye. The drama of wiki, irc, and the general Internet has gotten to me, and SB39 is going to retire. Haha, that sounded weird. Oh well. I want to thank many people for making this past ~13 months a blast for me. I'm sad to be leaving and I will take with me many great memories, fun times, and great friends. Congratulations to everyone for making Wikipedia such a good place. I'll miss you. Cheers,   22:00, 14 March 2009 (UTC)
Would anybody object if I removed this redirect and used it for Rail Lines, as (imo) it should be. I'm happy to clear up all the links to it with a bot if everyone is fine with it. I'm planning on starting adding these maps to our rail articles (and its also used on Waterways, Tramways, Metros etc) so it would be easier for me if I could use it as BS rather than having to define a new scheme for them. This redirect is also pointless imo anyway.
Apologies for the jumbled-ness of the post!
Cheers,
I was wondering about this, and since there is more vandalism here then ever before, there is a bigger change of colloidal damage by hard blocks. I want to purpose to add a group that has the ipblock-exempt right that allows users to edit even if they are being hit by a hard block. It could be used for people who need it, or it can be issued if the user can be trusted with this right. Also it can be assigned by administrators. Any thoughts? 
Ok, now that we discussed this, I'll purpose this
We create the ipblock-exempt group with only the ipblock-exempt right in it.
We allow checkusers only to add and remove the new group.
Administrators and Bureaucrats can not remove the right, however if they need to block a user with this right they can block the user directly and they will be blocked.
I don't really understand. As a registered user, if my IP address is blocked, can't I still edit regardless? Under what scenario would this permission be used? 16:14, 14 March 2009 (UTC) Found more info at (a good background for users who are not well versed in this topic). Thanks! 16:22, 14 March 2009 (UTC)
In my opinion, it is kind of pointless to leave the accountcreator group out of this vote because I believe that the accountcreator and ip-blockexempt groups go hand in hand. If we are going to enable one of the groups, we might as well enable the other. 19:25, 14 March 2009 (UTC)
Are we including the Account creator group in this proposal? 19:50, 14 March 2009 (UTC)
I noticed that there are barely any spoken articles on Simple Wikipedia, and was wondering if there is any interest in getting some recordings done. If there is, I can start plugging away at it in a couple of hours, but if there is truly no interest in having spoken articles, I won't bother.
Also, if there is interest, I would love some suggestions on what articles to start with. I'm thinking about starting with VGAs, but I'm open to any articles. Respectfully, () 10:36, 15 March 2009 (UTC)
I shall soon enough take a screen clipping of how the icons would look, and how it works. The image above is how Romania would look if the icon code were to be implemented. The code was simply:
This innovative icon system is much easier to handle, since it does not overlap existing icons; rather, it places itself automatically so it would fit next to the icon itself. That way, we don't have to go through the template, and simply add , etc. The second part of this proposition is to possibly replace (again, I'm sorry!) the icon stars and unite all the protection templates while replacing the protection lock. Here are the stars replicated below:
Note that the stars will not be pixelated, unlike its current status. Please place all discussions below. Thanks! 05:21, 15 March 2009 (UTC)
I like it. It's simple and elegant, it really gets the point across.
P.S. You should sign your posts :) () 05:10, 15 March 2009 (UTC)
Any idea how these will look with the Modern skin? The current system looks terrible (only half of the icon is typically visible), so I'm curious if this will be an improvement or not for those who use that skin. 12:23, 15 March 2009 (UTC)

Several days ago, I left Nameless User a note at about the creation of national football team articles. The articles being created are very empty of content and are basically restatements of the title: "X national football team is the national football team of X" with an infobox for the team's coach, World Cup appearances, and leading scorer. He stopped creating this for a little while, but continued today in a mass creation. Should these articles stay, or should they be removed as no content articles? () 10:16, 17 March 2009 (UTC)

"Polling ends on March 23, 2009."
It may just be that I'm logging on and seeing cached results or something odd, but every time I've been online for the past few times, the icons have changed. Can we please return to the original en.wiki icons before a consensus has been established that (1) we need to change the icons and (2) we need to change them to those above. We have a considerable number of templates and articles which now seem out of step with one another with respect to what denotes a GA and a VGA, yet another sign of the unprofessional view with which this Wikipedia will viewed if we don't work hard to fix it. () 00:45, 18 March 2009 (UTC)
I just noticed something. Per , contractions aren't acceptable except in quotations. If we're pushing that guideline, it should be followed universally across the most visible parts of the site. However, I noticed something. On the 'Changing PAGENAME' template, there are three instances of the word 'don't', where MOS states that it should be do not.
Don't be afraid to start and improve articles!

I don't know how easy it is to fix it, but it's rather flagrant. () 09:09, 19 March 2009 (UTC)
Addendum: There are also three contractions on the front page. Two instances of "don't", and one "doesn't". () 09:11, 19 March 2009 (UTC)
Not sure the best place to mention this, so here will have to do. I try to avoid the VGA/GA process, etc, unless there are glaring errors as I personally believe getting articles promoted has more to do with how many friends the nominator has on IRC than the quality of the article.
But today's offering is a worry - Cuban Missile Crisis.
Take the second sentence:
Confiscated does not mean "took over", but rather "took away" while American links to American - should it not be linked to United States?
Also, here:
The first sentence is odd, akin to putting "The British Empire in 1860, still powerful at the time..." while I don't believe Khrushchev was ever Russian president. Was he not General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union?
There is also a section on "Who won the Cuban Missile Crisis?" - how can a crisis be won or lost?
There are many other problems, some major, some minor, but I won't list them all now. Before I actually do so in the correct place, would anybody object to me listing the article for demotion? () 22:26, 20 March 2009 (UTC)
Hello, I would want to request import rights to import some warning templates from the English Wikipedia, and possibly some other templates I think would be useful. They can be simplified after. I've been working on twinkle to see what works and what not works, and I want to help out. 13:15, 16 March 2009 (UTC)
I'm importing lots of templates, like over 100, so I think it would be better if I did it, but I'll notify the admins anyway. 22:00, 16 March 2009 (UTC)
How is importing better than just copying from en and attributing in the edit summary? Seems that's what most people do and it works just fine. (It's probably faster, too.) 22:30, 16 March 2009 (UTC)
I don't see anything wrong with you having the rights as long as they are used sensibly. Regards, 23:10, 16 March 2009 (UTC)

It's true. The chief problem I see with Simple is that editors are unwilling to try out new ideas. Not all change is bad, you know. I've seen many proposals, which get automated - Simple is too small for this or - I don't like it or - some other reason. What's wrong with trying out new ideas? If they don't work for us, we don't have to keep the new change/proposal/process. But we will never know if we keep saying NO! to everything. 05:32, 21 March 2009 (UTC)
Does anyone else believe simple.wiki is almost becoming a bipartisan community (i.e. people like me, and people who believe that it should be solely on articles right now)? I really see a certain (not battle, but...) feud (?) between the community. It's almost like the liberal/conservative, Democratic/Republican, capitalist/communist clash. I personally don't want that on our wiki. Let's all be able to see both sides so this doesn't get comparable to politics. (not saying politics is bad; we need to be more open-minded, myself included). – 06:35, 21 March 2009 (UTC)
But, in all sincerity, I proposed this same topic a few archives back (remember?). I still there think there's a hesitancy of change. It sort of offends me that people view my icon thing as unimportant. But, hey, that's democracy, and I love it. ;) – 07:19, 21 March 2009 (UTC)
Speaking of opposition and the icon stuff, when is a reasonable time to close the vote? I think people are done voting, so we could close it now... but I set it for one week. I thought that was more than enough. Thoughts? – 08:14, 21 March 2009 (UTC)
We don't say no to everything, alot of stuff does change here when it fits within our mission plan. The things that continually get shot down are things that are "myspacy" and detract from the main purpose of this encyclopedia. And I think that is for a very good reason, the more time wasted on that stuff the more surely the wikipedia won't grow. Image uploading is a completely different thing, to be honest I don't know that even en.wiki should have it due to the huge amount of issues and time that it ends up creating. There are simply no articles that need a fair use image, are there some where it might make things easier? Of course there are, but that easiness in the article comes with a cost that is simply too high for our current community to deal with. If we had a thousand active editors then maybe it wouldn't be an issue (although its an issue at en.wiki with many thousands of editors). If anything I think the lack of fair use images actually forces us to be more creative and in the long run it makes the wiki better for it because we are forced to write better articles to make up for the lack of pictures. As far as the placement of icons go, it seems that you are the only one who notices they aren't placed properly...I have used all skins and never have I seen any of the issues you seem to complain about. Which is why I think you are getting alot of the if it ain't broke don't fix it comments. Making the icons all pretty doesn't necessarily make the wiki better, infact I think having big bright flashy icons can actually detract from the information in the article. But I don't care enough to oppose or support those changes as long as you go through and fix he few hundred templates you are going to break with this change. - () 13:54, 21 March 2009 (UTC)
Hello all,
please note that we haven't promoted any article to VGA status for almost a month; there are currently also no candidates listed. If you come across an article that you think would meet the , please it.-- () 12:16, 21 March 2009 (UTC)
Hey, when I'm editing in my userspace, certain things don't work. For example, all of the boxes on my userpage are collapsible, but I don't see the collapse button. However, when I'm preview mode, I see them perfectly. Please help! Thanks! – 17:57, 18 March 2009 (UTC)
Can anybody else see the collapsible boxes in my userpage? – 18:02, 18 March 2009 (UTC)
Okay, I guess glitch not fixed. It only works when I purge the cache. If I refresh the page (without the &action=purge), [hide] still doesn't show, and my time isn't positioned properly (with the class="icons"). – 04:16, 19 March 2009 (UTC)
...about the new icons. Look, we had a vote. It was voted in favor, 11-3. I don't want to follow the English Wikipedia on this one. After the proposition, I was almost absolutely sure I wouldn't comment anymore about the icons here, as I know it bugs some of you guys no end. Trust me, I don't want to send a million messages about the icons. I thought since I was done doing the overhaul, that was that. But I have learned not anybody is in favor of the icons or of my choices, I guess. 03:38, 24 March 2009 (UTC)
If you find another icon that looks nice to you, please add it to the gallery below. Let's have a composite of different icons juxtaposed next to each other. See for more ideas. Peace and love, 03:38, 24 March 2009 (UTC)
I actually liked using the normal English VGA icon, but that's just me. — () 03:41, 24 March 2009 (UTC)

Nuclear explosion

A nuclear explosion is energy being released from a very fast nuclear reaction. It can be caused by nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, or both.
Atmospheric nuclear explosions are associated with "mushroom clouds", although mushroom clouds can occur as a result of large chemical explosions. It is also possible to have an air-burst nuclear explosion without these clouds. Nuclear explosions produce radiation and radioactive debris.
The nuclear weapon was first detonated in combat on 6 August 1945, when the United States dropped a uranium gun-type device on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. The second and last use of a nuclear weapon in combat occurred three days later when United States dropped a plutonium implosion-type device on the Japanese city of Nagasaki. These bombings resulted in the immediate deaths of around 120,000 people while more died over time due the nuclear radiation.

Polygar Wars

Polygar War or Palayakarar Wars refers to the wars fought between the Polygars ("Palayakarrars") of former Madurai Kingdom in Tamil Nadu, India and the British colonial forces between March 1799 to May 1802. The British finally won after carrying out long and difficult protracted jungle campaigns against the Polygar armies and finally defeated them. Many lives were lost on both sides and the victory over Polygars made large part of territories of Tamil Nadu coming under British control enabling them to get a strong hold in India.
The war between the British and Kattabomman Nayak of Panchalankurichi Palayam in the then Tirunelveli region is often classified as the First Polygar war. In 1799, a brief meeting (over pending taxes) between Kattabomman and the British ended in a bloody encounter in which the British commander of the forces was slain by the former. A price was put on Kattabomman head prompting many Polygars to an open rebellion. 
After a series of battles in the Panchalankurichi fort with additional reinforcements from Thiruchirapalli, Kattabomman was defeated but he escaped to the jungles in Pudukottai country. Here he was captured by Pudukottai Rajah (after an agreement with the British) and after a summary trial Kattabomman was hanged in front of the public in order to intimidate them, near Kayattar Fort, close to the town of Kovilpatti and in front of fellow Polygars too who had been summoned to witness the execution.
Subramania Pillai, a close associate of Kattabomman Nayak, was also publicly hanged and his head was fixed on a pike at Panchalankurichi for public view. Soundra Pandian Nayak, another rebel leader, was brutally done to death by having his head dashed against a village wall. Kattabomman’s brother Oomaidurai was imprisoned in Palayankottai prison while the fort was razed to ground and his wealth looted by the troops.
Despite the suppression of the First Polygar War in 1799, rebellion broke out again in 1800. The Second war was more stealthy and covert in nature. The leaders operated more cohesive and united with people from Kerala and Mysore taking part. Also it marked the joining of entire west Tamil Nadu, Malabar and south Mysore regions (which was under British domain after the death of Tipu Sultan).Dheeran Chinnamalai commanded a vast army,He settled down at Odanilai and constructed a fort there to continue his struggle against the British, whom he defeated in battles at Cauvery in 1801, Odanilai in 1802 and Arachalur in 1804. Later, Dheeran Chinnamalai left his fort to avoid cannon attack and engaged in guerrilla warfare while he was stationed at Karumalai in the Palani region.
He was betrayed by his cook and captured by the British, who hanged him at Sankari Fort on July 31, 1805.
The British finally won after a long expensive campaign that took more than a year. However, the superior British military who had recently defeated the powerful Tipu Sultan of Mysore quickly asserted itself. The British had better artillery compared to the Polygar troops who had country-made gunfire artillery, barring a few proper ones received from erstwhile Tipu Sultan's army. The war being regional in nature, the British forces could easily mobilize additional forces from other regions.
So savage and extensive was the death and destruction wrought by the English that the entire region was left in a state of terror.
Dheeran Chinnamalai was betrayed by his cook and captured by the British, who hanged him at Sankari Fort on July 31 or August 2, 1805. At last entire region of Tamil Nadu came under the control of Britishers after the end of Chinnamalai.
Tamil Nadu government constructed a "mani mandapam" (memorial) for Chinnamalai in Arachalur, Erode district at a cost of about 30 lakhs. Tamil Nadu government placed a statue of Chinnamalai in Chennai.[1]

Dheeran Chinnamalai ( born as Theerthagiri Sarkkarai Mandraadiyaar [Sarkkarai Mandraadiyaar Refers Payiran Kulam] or Theerthagiri Gounder on April 17, 1756) was a Kongu chieftain and Palayakkarar from Tamil Nadu who rose up in revolt against the British East India Company in the Kongu Nadu, Southern India. He was born in Melapalayam, near Erode in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
He was one of the main leaders in the Polygar Wars and commanded a vast army, notably during the Second Polygar War that took place in 1801–1802. A thousand-strong army under him took French Military training in modern warfare alongside Tipu's Mysore forces to fight against the British East India company. They helped Tipu Sultan in his war against the British and were instrumental in victories at Chitheswaram, Mazahavalli and Srirangapatna.

Rainbow lorikeet

The rainbow lorikeet ("Trichoglossus haematodus") is an Australasian parrot. This brightly colored parrot lives on the east coast of Australia, eastern Indonesia (Maluku and Western New Guinea), Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.
In Australia, it is common along the eastern seaboard, from Queensland to South Australia and Tasmania. Its habitat is rainforest, coastal bush and woodland areas. 
It has a number of subspecies, in fact, some classifications list about 20 subspecies.
Rainbow lorikeets are monogamous and pair for life, and the two sexes look almost identical. They are strongly territorial, and chase off other birds. In some places (Western Australia, North Island of New Zealand) they have been artificially introduced, and are looked on as a pest species.
It is a large lorikeet, about tall. It is has green feathers on its back, wings and tail. It has bright red feathers on the chest, with orange and yellow feathers on the sides of its chest. It has deep blue feathers on its abdomen and head. It also has stripes of yellow among its green feathers. It has a bright red bill with grey legs and feet.

World Poverty and Human Rights

World Poverty and Human Rights is a 2002 book by Thomas Pogge. In the book, Pogge says that the poorest 46 percent of people have 1.2 percent of global income, and 826 million of them do not have enough to eat. One-third of all human deaths are from poverty-related causes: 18 million annually, including 12 million children under five.
At the other end of the spectrum, the 15 percent of people in the developed countries have 80 percent of global income. Pogge says that shifting 1 or 2 percent of our share toward poverty eradication seems morally compelling. Yet most of the rich people believe that they have no such responsibility.

<doc id="173705" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=173705" title="Edmund Husserl">
Edmund Husserl

Edmund Gustav Albrecht Husserl (; April 8, 1859, Prostějov, Moravia, Austrian Empire – April 26, 1938, Freiburg, Germany) was a philosopher who is deemed the founder of phenomenology. He broke with the positivist orientation of the science and philosophy of his time, believing that experience is the source of all knowledge.
Husserl studied mathematics under Karl Weierstraß, completing a Ph.D. under Leo Königsberger, and studied philosophy under Franz Brentano and Carl Stumpf.
Then Husserl taught philosophy, as a "Privatdozent" at Halle from 1887, and as a professor:
Husserl was born into a Jewish family in a town that was then in the Austrian Empire, after 1918 a part of Czechoslovakia, and since 1993 a part of the Czech Republic.
He initially studied mathematics but then started attending lectures on psychology and philosophy. Husserl was so impressed by Brentano that he decided to dedicate his life to philosophy.
His major written work is "Philosophie der Arithmetik" (1891). In these first works he tries to combine mathematics, psychology and philosophy with a main goal to provide a sound foundation for mathematics. He analyzes the psychological process needed to obtain the concept of number and then tries to build up a systematical theory on this analysis. To achieve this he uses several methods and concepts taken from his teachers. From Weierstrass he derives the idea that we generate the concept of number by counting a certain collection of objects. From Brentano and Stumpf he takes over the distinction between "proper" and "improper" presenting.
In an example Husserl explains this in the following way: if you are standing in front of a house, you have a proper, direct presentation of that house, but if you are looking for it and ask for directions, then these directions (e.g. the house on the corner of this and that street) are an indirect, improper presentation. In other words, you can have a proper presentation of an object if it is actually present, and an improper (or symbolic as he also calls it) if you only can indicate that object through signs, symbols, etc. 
Another important element that Husserl took over from Brentano is intentionality, the notion that the main characteristic of consciousness is that it is always intentional. While often simplistically summarised as "aboutness" or the relationship between mental acts and the external world, Brentano defined it as the main characteristic of "mental phenomena", by which they could be distinguished from "physical phenomena". 
Some years after the publication of his main work, the "Logische Untersuchungen" ("Logical Investigations"; 1900-1901) Husserl made some key conceptual elaborations which led him to assert that in order to study the structure of consciousness, one would have to distinguish between the act of consciousness and the phenomena at which it is directed (the object-in-itself, transcendent to consciousness). 
Knowledge of essences would only be possible by "bracketing" all assumptions about the existence of an external world. He called this procedure "epoché".
Husserl then started to concentrate on the ideal, essential structures of consciousness.
The metaphysical problem of establishing what kind of reality we perceive was of little interest to Husserl in spite of his being a transcendental idealist.
Husserl proposed that the world of objects and ways in which we direct ourselves toward and perceive those objects is normally conceived of in what he called the "natural standpoint", which is characterized by a belief that objects materially exist and exhibit properties that we see as emanating from them.
Husserl proposed a radical new phenomenological way of looking at objects by examining how we in our many ways of being intentionally directed toward them, actually " "constitute" " them (to be distinguished from materially " "creating objects or objects" ".
In a later period, Husserl began to wrestle with the complicated issues of intersubjectivity, specifically, how communication about an object can be assumed to refer to the same ideal entity ("Cartesian Meditations", Meditation V).
Husserl tries new methods of bringing his readers to understand the importance of phenomenology to scientific observation: specifically he refers to psychology) and what he means for "bracketing natural attitude".
"The Crisis of the European Sciences" is Husserl's unfinished work that deals most directly with these issues. In it, Husserl for the first time attempts a historical overview of the development of Western philosophy and science, emphasizing the challenges presented by their increasingly (one-sidedly) empirical and naturalistic orientation.
Husserl declares that mental and spiritual reality possess their own reality independent of any physical basis.

The Orto botanico di Pisa, also known as the Orto Botanico dell'Università di Pisa, is a botanical garden, and the University of Pisa takes care of it. The garden is at via Luca Ghini 5, Pisa, Italy. It is open weekday mornings and it does not cost money to see it.
The garden was started in 1544 under Cosimo I de' Medici as the first university botanical garden in Europe, and it was put under the care of the famous botanist Luca Ghini of Imola. In 1563 the garden was moved from its original place near a river (now the Medicean Arsenal) to one near the convent of Santa Marta. In 1591 the garden was again moved to a third place, where it still is. From these early times, the garden has contained a gallery of natural objects (now Pisa's Museo di Storia Naturale), a library (now part of the university library), and portraits of its directors throughout the centuries. It also includes one of the earliest iron-framed hothouses built in Italy.
Today there are different sections in the garden containing the botanical school, gardens, ponds, greenhouses, and various buildings. Major collections include herb gardens and arboreta, as well as the old botany institute, built 1591–1595, with a facade ornamented with sea-shells.

Seismology

Seismology is the study of what is under the surface of the Earth by measuring vibrations on the Earth's surface. A person who does this is called a seismologist. 
It is part of the science of geophysics, which studies the physics of the processes that formed the Earth and other planets. 
Seismology is done by seismologists and geophysicists using devices to pick up the vibrations called geophones, hydrophones or seismometers.
Seismology can either be passive, just listening to vibrations caused by earthquakes and volcanic activity, or active, using small explosive charges to send vibrations into the ground.
Seismic detectors come in two types, one which measures up and down vibrations, and one which measures side to side vibrations. Both types use and arrangement of a magnet and a coil of wire which will convert the vibrations into an electrical signal which can be stored in a computer for analysis.
Seismologists can find the location of earthquakes by plotting received vibrations on a map. They can also pick up underground nuclear tests, and this is what many of the seismic recording stations were set up for.
They can also examine the crust in a seismic survey to try and find information about layers of rock, locate oil or gas fields and to get information about the internal structure of volcanos.

A godparent is an adult who sponsors a child during a formal religious ceremony or rite. Many religions have godparents or other adults who do something almost the same. These religions include Christianity & Judaism. Usually a godparent must be a member of the religion of the child.
Originally a godparent was someone who agreed to help raise the child and help them to become a good member of the religion. They may also have taken over as parent to the child if both its real parents died. Today, the role of godparent is not often a formal one, and has no real responsibility to the child. A female child of a godparent is a goddaughter. A male child of a godparent is a godson.

Nystagmus, often called "dancing eyes", is an eye condition which causes uncontrolled, rapid, jerky, movement of the eyes, usually from side to side, but sometimes up and down or in a circular motion. Most people with nystagmus have poor vision. It causes problems in education, employment and many social situations. Nystagmus cannot be fixed by spectacles or contact lenses, although many people with nystagmus wear glasses or contact lenses to correct other eye problems.
There are two types of Nystagmus. The first is Infantile Nystagmus Syndrome (INS) which some people have at birth. The second type is known as acquired nystagmus which has a number of causes including:
There are currently no cures for nystagmus, but UK Nystagmus Network supports and encourages medical and other research into this complex condition. Research is ongoing with a number of universities leading the way.

Susanna (Book of Daniel)

The story of Susanna and the Elders is found in some Bibles inside chapter three of the Book of Daniel. These sections are sometimes called Additions to Daniel. Modern Jewish and Protestant Bibles do not have this story but Catholic and Orthodox ones have it. This story is found before Daniel 1:1 as a prologue in very old Greek texts. It is found as chapter 13 in the Vulgate and modern Catholic Bibles.
In the story, two bad judges secretly want to have sexual intercourse with Susanna, a beautiful and virtuous wife. One hot day, she takes a bath inside her walled garden but she does not know that the judges are hiding inside the garden. The judges tell her to have sex with them but she doesn't want to. When she refuses, they tell the people of the village that they saw her having sex with a man who was not her husband. This is called adultery, which was against the law at that time. The people of the village believe the judges and want to kill Susanna. A boy named Daniel does not believe the judges, so he asks one of the judges to go away and the other one to say what he saw. Daniel does this again with the other judge. The judges tell different stories, showing that they lied. The people get mad and kill the judges instead.

Hello. I have been dedicating some time and effort to re-write this article and I think I now appears to meet the majority of GA standards. Right now there appears to be no redlinks (not including the template at the very bottom), and contains more than 10kb of information. It also contains a dozen references. I think that Dead Memories is a freaken awesome that it has been stuck in my head for several days, which somehow motivated me to contribute to the article.
Note: If you're a fan of metal or Slipknot, you should give it a listen. :) -- 21:12, 22 February 2009 (UTC)
This is an article I wrote from scratch for enWP and imported here (as copyright holder). It has a couple of redlinks (which I will fix) but it is very well sourced and I think that it meets all the PGA criteria now. It could do with at lest one image, but i've been unable to find a relevant one. I can add images of NYPD police, but not of any free images of NYPD undercover cops wearing the color of the day. It has had one DYK nom that got two yes !votes, which is pretty good I guess. 06:16, 8 March 2009 (UTC)
OK, I've put in a lot of time for this article and it is now ready for GA imo. I'd be greatly honored if it passed.   23:57, 27 February 2009 (UTC)
This article looks good to me, and very nicely illustrated. Just a couple of redlinks I'll make, but apart from that looks like GA standards. 19:46, 2 March 2009 (UTC)
I present to the community Crich Tramway Village for consideration as a Good Article. I believe that it meets most of the criteria, and that it is pretty much as good as it can get. I admit there are still a few things that need doing, including red link creation, further simplification and copy-editing, but this will be completed during this discussion time as will any other issues that are raised.

Probably is close to meeting GA requirements. Meets 7-8 of 9 criteria, just need some extra attention from editors.
Hmmm...not sure about this one. I'll give you some more information once I look over the article in more detail. Cheers, 00:10, 28 March 2009 (UTC)

"Röhm (second from right) after rendition of judgement on April 1, 1924" What is "rendition of judgement" (note that judgment has no E between the G and M)? It's never mentioned in the article. "Hitler with Röhm wearing the SA uniform in 1933" is confusing too. Who's wearing the SA uniform? Why is Röhm presented "after" Hitler in this? As he's the subject of the article, he should be first and Hitler should be with him. () 14:37, 10 April 2009 (UTC)

Lucifugum

Lucifugum is a black metal band from Ukraine.
Lucifugum is a popular black metal band from Ukraine. They and Nokturnal Mortum are two of the best-known exponents of the East European black metal scene. Lucifugum was formed in 1995 by poet/composer Khlyst and musicians Bal-a-Myth (guitar, bass) and Faunus (vocals). The band continues to perform, despite Faunus having left the band in 2001, and Bal-a-Myth having died in his sleep on October 5, 2002; the albums "Back to Chopped Down Roots" and "Sociopath: Philosophy Cynicism" were recorded in 2003 by numerous session musicians which, however, did not join the band. In 2004 Khlyst moved to the Ukrainian town Mykolayiv (Nikolaev) to continue the activity of Lucifugum and Propaganda together with local black metal musician Elena (aka Stabaath) (ex-Namtar, ex-Hesperus). "Vector33" is the first album with Stabaath (she recorded vocals, guitar, bass, and keyboards). All lyrics are written by Khlyst, and music is composed by Stabaath and Khlyst. Khlyst and Stabaath (real names Igor and Elena Naumchuk) are married. They are the owners of black metal label Propaganda.
The music of Lucifugum was different and changed during the years. The early period can be described as symphonic black metal (1996-2000), later it was black/thrash metal, sometimes with death metal touches (2001-2003), and after 2004 the music of the band has transformed into pure black metal style.
According to Propaganda web site (details to album “Sublimessiah”) Khlyst performs vocals since 2014. The critical problems with Stabaath’s throat have stopped her during the record of the vocal. So, there are just 3 tracks (1,3,5) with Stabaath’s vocals on “Sublimessiah”.

Grassland

A grassland is an area of land that mostly contains grasses. There are wild grasses, and less trees.
Several parts of the world have grasslands. Grasslands are found in Africa, North America, Central Asia, South America, and near the coasts of Australia. The largest grasslands are in East Africa. Grasslands with a few scattered trees are called savannas. Others are called prairies or steppes. 
Little rain falls in a grassland biome. Between 25 and 75 cm of rain falls each year, which makes the weather in these savannas hot and sunny in the summer and cool in the winter months.
Grassland vegetation can vary greatly in height. The chalk grassland of southern England is quite short, often with small, delicate chalkland flowers. 
Grass is quite tall in North American "tallgrass prairie", South American grasslands and African savannas. This provides a degree of cover for the smaller animals, and so it increases the number of species which can live there.
Woody plants, shrubs or trees, may occur on some grasslands.
As flowering plants and trees, grasses grow in great concentrations in climates where annual rainfall ranges between . The root systems of perennial grasses and forbs form complex mats that hold the soil in place.
The tallgrass prairie is the native ecosystem of North America before it was replaced by modern farming. 
Retreating glaciers dropped material about 10,000 years ago. Wind-dropped loess and organic matter accumulated. This made the soil. The prairie had the deepest level of topsoil recorded anywhere. Animals such as buffalo, elk, deer, and rabbits added nitrogen to the soil with their urine and feces. Prairie dogs dug tunnels that "aerated the soil and channeled water several feet below the surface".
For 5,000 to 8,000 years, more than of prairie grasslands were a major feature of the landscape. 
Between 1800 and 1930, most of it was destroyed. Settlers transformed what they called "the Great American Desert" or "The Inland Sea" into farmland. They replaced the old grasses with new ones, mostly wheat and maize. They replaced the bison with cattle, another kind of bovine. About 40% of the world's maize for example grows in the United States, mostly on land that formerly grew grass. The grazing pattern of European cattle, the near-extermination of prairie dogs, and the plowing and cultivation of the land, did the damage. Plowing cut tallgrass root systems and interrupted reproduction. Drainage changed the soil's water content, and soil erosion lost soil.
Estimates differ of how much original tallgrass prairie survives. Perhaps less than 1% mostly in "scattered remnants found in pioneer cemeteries, restoration projects, along highways and railroad rights-of-way, and on steep bluffs high above rivers", to 4%.
There are few trees in the grassland because of the low rainfall. Thorny trees called acacias are one of a handful of trees that are able to grow here. Wildfires are common and destroy trees. The animals also prevent trees from growing as they eat the tender sprouts before they can develop into grown trees. Elephants are known to tear down grown-up trees and feed on their leaves, making trees even more scarce.
Grass can still grow because it survives the aridity and the trampling of the animals. This is why grasslands can feed the vast numbers of animals, from the mice, rats, and other small animals that eat the seeds and sprouts, to the large herds of animals.
There are many animals living in the grasslands. Some examples of animals are: mice, rats, snakes, hawks, eagles, zebras, lions, ostriches, giraffes, rhinos, elephants, and antelope.

California Proposition 8

Proposition 8 is an initiative passed in California on November 4, 2008 that banned same-sex marriage. The measure passed by 52% to 48%. It changed California's Constitution by adding a section that says, "Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California." The law was in response to a judge's ruling that gay marriage was legal under the California state Constitution. The campaign to pass Proposition 8 was mostly paid for by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
Proposition 8 is controversial and is being debated in court. On August 4, 2010, Judge Vaughn Walker in the United States District Court made a ruling that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional and should be overturned. This would make same-sex marriage legal again in California, however, Judge Walker issued a stay of execution, so that those in favor of Proposition 8 could legal appeal.
The appeal of the case went to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On February 7, 2012, the judges in this court agreed with Judge Walker that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional. However they also issued a stay of execution, so that their ruling could be appealed to the United States Supreme Court.
Those in favor of Proposition 8 appealed to the Supreme Court on July 30, 2012. On December 7, 2012, the Supreme Court agreed to judge the case. The Supreme Court will issue a final ruling on the case in 2013.
There are several possible outcomes:
Depending on exactly how the Supreme Court rules, Proposition 8 could be overturned in California only, or all other laws against same-sex marriage in the United States could be overturned as well.

Czechoslovak government-in-exile

The Czechoslovak government-in-exile (sometimes called officially as: provisional government of Czechoslovakia) was an informal name given to the Czechoslovak National Liberation Committee, first by British diplomatic recognition. The name was used by other World War II Allies as they followed the British in recognizing it. The Committee was originally created by the former Czechoslovak President, Edvard Beneš in Paris, France in October 1939. Unsuccessful negotiations with France for diplomatic status, as well as the impending Nazi occupation of France, forced the Committee to move to London in 1940. From there, it moved to Aston Abbots, Buckinghamshire in 1941, where it sought relative safety from the London Blitz.
It was the true government for Czechoslovakia throughout the Second World War. A specifically anti-Fascist government, it sought to reverse the Munich Agreement and the following German occupation of Czechoslovakia, and to return the Republic to its 1937 boundaries. Due to this it was considered, by those countries that recognized it, the legal continuation of the First Republic of Czechoslovakia.

Train

A train is a set of vehicles on a railway. The vehicles in a set are called "cars" (in the United States) or "wagons" (in the United Kingdom). Often, people refer to the ones that carry passengers as Coaches or Carriages. A place where a train stops to let people get on and off is called a railway station. Early trains used horse power and ran on wooden or iron tracks. These were used in the Middle Ages. The first steam trains were built in England in the early 19th century. 
Trains contain the prime mover (either locomotive or motor unit) and one or more cars. The locomotive or railway engine (the first car of the train) pulls the cars along the track. Some trains look like a special bus that can only drive on rails. Trains are used to carry people, as well as cargo, such as fuel, imported/exported goods, and so on.
Freight trains have freight cars (US) or goods wagons (UK) to carry goods from one place to another. Some are boxcars (closed and roofed cars for cargo); others are special so they can carry special cargo. There are hopper cars for sand, coal, ore and other granulous (sand-like) materials, flatbed cars for vehicles and machinery, tank cars for liquids, container cars for containers and even bottle cars for molten iron. Almost anything which is not too large to fit under tunnels and bridges can be transported on special freight cars.
Passenger trains have passenger cars (US) or coaches (UK) made so people can ride them from one train station to another. There are few long-distance passenger trains in the United States, but more in Europe and Asia. Most passenger cars are single-deckers: there are also double-decker passenger cars, such as the Finnish Inter-City cars.
Passenger trains are usually a very comfortable way of traveling. Many trains have electrical outlets and Wi-Fi hotspots for computers, and a special restaurant car for dining and refreshments. There are also sleeping cars (passenger cars with beds) for long overnight voyages.
Some unusually fast passenger trains on special tracks are called "bullet trains". A few even faster ones are maglev trains using magnets to hover slightly off the tracks to have less friction.
Most trains are pulled by locomotives. Before 1900, almost all were steam locomotives. As this kind of steam engine uses very much fuel for the work it does, steam began to give way to diesel locomotives and electric locomotives during the 1930s. Today, most locomotives are diesel-electric locomotives.
Sometimes a train has no separate locomotive, but the prime mover (diesel engine or electric motor) is located on the first car of the train itself, and the car has engineer's cabin. The car is called a "motor unit". Some trains have motors in many or all of the cars. This is called a diesel multiple unit or electric multiple unit. Usually, both ends of the train have engineer's cabins. These trains are especially popular in commuter traffic in large towns and cities.

<doc id="173951" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=173951" title="Sullivan Bay, Victoria">
Sullivan Bay, Victoria

Sullivan Bay is the site of the first official European settlement in Victoria, Australia. It is a very small bay near Sorrento, Victoria. It is close to the entrance of Port Phillip Bay, south of the city of Melbourne.
In 1802, Governor Philip Gidley King in Sydney had written to Lord Hobart, Minister in charge of the colonies, in London, saying that Britain should start a settlement at Port Phillip Bay. King thought it would be good area for fishing and sealing. He was also worried that the French might settle in the area and then would control Bass Strait. Lieutenant John Murray had explored Port Phillip Bay in 1802 and thought that the Sorrento area would be a good spot to start a settlement.
Lieutenant Governor David Collins was put in charge of starting the new settlement. He took 307 convicts, some with wives and children, 51 soldiers, 17 free settlers, some with wives and children, and a government staff of 12, and a clergyman, the Reverend Knopwood. The group of more than 400 people left England in April 1803, in the store ship “Ocean” and the convict ship “Calcutta.”
The two ships sailed to Tenerife in the Canary Islands, Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, Capetown in South Africa, and arrived at Port Phillip Bay on 6 October and 8 October 1803. Only 14 people died on the trip. Collins was unable to find a good place to land that had drinking water and good soil. On 13 October 1803, he landed at Sullivan’s Bay, which he named after the Under Secretary of the Colonial War Department.
The new settlers were able to get water by putting wooden barrels into the sand, and letting the water in the ground soak into them. It was salty and not nice to drink. The soil was very sandy and not suitable for farming. There were very few trees suitable for cutting up into building timber. The sandy ground meant that heavy items could not be carried in a wagon, which would be stuck in the sand, but had to be dragged instead. The small entrance to the bay made it difficult for sailing ships to get in or out safely. The tools brought from England, such a spades, hoes and axes, were very badly made and broke easily. Coscape. He had hoped to increase the food supply with fresh fish and kangaroos, but they were not able to catch any.
Male convicts were given a set of clothes in October 1803 which included:
The food ration each week was:
Women were to be given 2/3 of that amount, children half the amount, and small children under 5 years, ¼ of the .
A convict printer, Robert Walsh printed the orders and instructions for the settlement on a small printing press. During the time of the settlement 43 such orders were printed.
Collins told the convicts not to go into the water to wash because of the danger from hungry sharks and stingrays. Some tried to escape by walking overland to Sydney. They soon gave up and went back to the settlement. Settler, John Skilton, died on 17 October 1803. On 25 November 1803, the first child, William James Hobart Thorne, was born to a soldier, Sergeant Thorne and his wife. One child of convict parents was John Pascoe Fawkner, who returned to start the settlement of Melbourne in 1835.
In November, Collins sent the “Ocean” to Sydney with a letter asking King to let him abandon the settlement, and move it to either Port Dalrymple or the Derwent River in Van Diemen's Land. The “Ocean” came back in December and Collins wasted no time in getting most of the convicts and settlers packed up. He gave an order that convicts had to work on Sundays to make sure the group was ready to leave as soon as possible. On 30 January 1804, the “Ocean” set sail for the Derwent River. Lieutenant William Sladden was left behind in charge of a small group. The “Ocean” returned and on 20 May 1804, the settlement was abandoned.
Three people were left behind after the settlement was abandoned, two were escaped convicts and one was a runaway soldier, William Buckley. When John Batman came to settle in Victoria 30 years later, he found Buckley living with an aboriginal tribe. The only sign of the settlement now is four graves at Sullivan Bay, and the remains of a water barrel in the Latrobe Library collection.

Romanization of Bulgarian

The Streamlined System for the Romanization of Bulgarian is a system of transliteration of the Bulgarian alphabet created by Lyubomir Ivanov in the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences in 1995, which is defined by the following table:
The system was originally developed to serve for the Romanization of Bulgarian geographical names in Antarctica. It was adopted by the Antarctic Place-names Commission of Bulgaria on 2 March 2005. An early explanation of the Streamlined System was made in 1997 to the US and UK Antartcic place-naming authorities. They had noticed the difference from their 1952 BGN/PCGN romanization of Bulgarian. The new system became subject to comparative study at the Department of English and American Studies at Sofia University.
Subsequently, the system was chosen by the Bulgarian Government. It is the official transliteration system to be used in all identity documents, road signs, street names, official information systems, databases, local authorities’ websites etc. Eventually, the Streamlined System became part of Bulgarian law by way of the passed in 2009.
The Streamlined system was adopted also by UN in 2012, and for official US and UK use, by BGN and PCGN in 2013. Ivanov proposes using his Romanization approach in the case of Cyrillic alphabets of other Slavic languages, notably Russian.
The Streamlined System was designed with the aim of striking an optimal balance between the following partly overlapping and partly conflicting priorities:
Exceptions: 
It had been proposed to modify the Streamlined System so that Bulgarian letters Ъ and Ц were transliterated as "Ă" and "TZ" respectively. However, those proposals failed to gain wider acceptance, and were not adopted for official usage.
The system is not invertible, for А, Ж, Й, Ц, Ш, Щ, Ю, Я are transliterated in the same way as are Ъ, ЗХ, Ь, ТС, СХ, ШТ, ЙУ, ЙА respectively. An auxiliary, invertible variant of the system without the ИЯ-exception rule is proposed by L. Ivanov, D. Skordev and D. Dobrev to be used in those special cases when the exact retrieval of Bulgarian words from their Romanized forms is a priority, with Cyrillic letters and combinations of letters 
Ъ, Ь, ЗХ, ЙА, ЙУ, СХ, ТС, ТШ, ТЩ, ШТ, ШЦ transliterated as "`A", "`Y", "Z|H", "Y|A", "Y|U", "S|H", "T|S", "T|SH", "T|SHT", "SH|T", "SH|TS" respectively. In order to ensure full invertibility of the system, including the case of the ИЯ-exception rule, one may transliterate word-final -ИА as "I|A" rather than "IA". The plain streamlined transliteration word form could be retrieved from its invertible variant by simply removing the additional symbols ` and |.
The Streamlined System is based on an English-oriented transliteration, taking advantage of the global "lingua franca" role of English. A similar shift towards English-oriented transliteration is observed in the case of other Cyrillic alphabets such as Russian and Ukrainian, and to some extent Macedonian. 
The Streamlined System is similar to the old 1952 BGN/PCGN System for the Romanization of Bulgarian, which had been official in the USA and the United Kingdom until 2013. The latter however transliterates the Cyrillic letters Х, Ь and Ъ as "KH", "’" (apostrophe) and "Ŭ", while the former uses "H", "Y" and "A" instead.
Another similar system not adopted for official use in Bulgaria is that of A. Danchev, M. Holman, E. Dimova and M. Savova, which transliterates the Cyrillic letters У and Ъ by "OU" and "U" respectively, while the Streamlined System uses "U" and "A" for this purpose. Furthermore, the latter system transliterates the digraphs АЙ•ай, ЕЙ•ей, ОЙ•ой and УЙ•уй by AI•ai, EI•ei, OI•oi and OUI•oui instead of AY•ay, EY•ey, OY•oy and UY•uy respectively.

Durand Line

The Durand Line is a frontier boundary between Afghanistan and Pakistan. It was established after an 1893 memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Mortimer Durand of British India and Afghan Amir Abdur Rahman Khan. Referred to as a frontier line, it is named after Mortimer Durand who was the Foreign Secretary of colonial British India at the time. The 1893 MoU is a one page document, signed by Durand and Khan in which the two men agreed that Afghanistan and British India would remain friends, and not start war with each other. It also mentions that the military of Khan may import weapons into Afghanistan through the Afghan tribal areas and that British India would pay money to Khan every year. In 1947, British India ended and the new state of Pakistan was created. In 1949, Afghanistan announced that the 1893 MoU became void (no longer valid) and has never accepted it since then.
The Durand Line cuts through the Afghan tribal areas, politically dividing ethnic Pashtuns and Baloch people who live on both sides. Although shown on maps as the western international border of Pakistan, it remains unrecognized by Afghanistan and leaders of the Pashtun people in Pakistan. The local people of the region have always refused to recognize the Durand Line, they cross it back and forth without documents. Afghan Pashtun leaders claim Pakistani territories and say that the Durand Line is "an issue of historical importance for Afghanistan. The Afghan people, not the government, can take a final decision on it."

Unsafe abortion

An unsafe abortion is an abortion which is not done by a person which has the skills to do them (a licensed doctor), or in a place that does not meet at least basic standards of hygiene. Unsafe abortions can be very dangerous to the mother. Many women die or get a disease because they had an unsafe abortion. About 95 percent of unsafe abortions happen in developing countries.
Two very common ways that unsafe abortions are done are:
A back-alley abortion (Back-Yard Abortion in Australia) is the common slang term for an illegal abortion in the English-speaking world. 
The method using the coat hanger, as described above, was known by many people. This method was not what was done normally, though. In fact, Mary Calderone, former medical director of Planned Parenthood, said, in a 1960 printing of the "American Journal of Public Health":
Herbal abortions (when done illegally) can also be described as back-alley abortions because they are not induced in a medical facility.
The argument of back-alley abortions was used to help make abortion legal in the United States. In 1973, the US Supreme Court decided that abortion should be legalized. It was treating a case called Roe v. Wade. Since then, it has become a central argument on the part of some prominent legal abortion advocates. Gerri Santoro died of blood loss after a back-alley abortion. Her photo was used extensively to illustrate the dangers of illegal abortions.
Bernard Nathanson performed many abortions but later was against them. He has said that many of the statistics that show that many women died from back-alley abortions in the US are false. He said that he and his colleagues made many such statistics to lead people to believe that legalizing abortion was a good thing to do.

The Araluen Zieria ("Zieria adenophora"), is a small shrub found in only one place, on a slope above the Araluen Creek, near Araluen, New South Wales, Australia. In 2001 there were only 56 known plants. The plants were first collected in 1888, and were then thought to have become extinct. The Zieria was rediscovered in the late 1980s.
It is a small shrub, which is related to the boronia plants. It is about tall and wide, though some plants have grown up to tall. It has a small white or pink flower with four petals, about long. The plant has flowers in spring, from August to October. It also has small green leaves which are trifoliate, in three parts like a clover leaf. The leaves have a strong smell.
The plants have only been found near the Araluen Creek. They are growing on a steep, rocky, hillside.
The plant has been listed as Endangered under the Australian Government's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. It is also listed by the New South Wales Government, Endangered (Schedule 1, Part 1) on the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. It is endangered because there are so few of the plants and they are only found in one place. A bushfire could destroy all the plants. There is also a danger from wild goats in the area. The goats do not eat the Zieria, but they could walk on the new seedlings and crush them. The goats might eat all the other plants which could lead to erosion and the soil could be washed away. Weeds growing around the plants might also stop new Zierias from growing.
There is now a plan to protect the plant. These plans include:

Jules Henri Poincaré (29 April 1854 – 17 July 1912) was a French mathematician and scientist. He was described as a "monster of mathematics " when still a child. Many people think he was the last person to understand all branches of mathematics before the subject became too big for anyone to do this. 
He came from a clever family, his father was a professor of medicine and his cousin, Raymond Poincaré became president of France. He was sick as a child and for many years he had to be taught at home by his mother.
He used his mathematical skills to look at some of the biggest problems in science in his day. He was the first person to describe in mathematical terms how three planets in orbit affect each others paths as they pass near by one another. This was called the Three Body Problem. He also tried to understand why the speed of light seems to be the fastest speed at which anything can travel in the universe. In some ways he beat the famous scientist Albert Einstein to solving this question, but Einstein gave a more complete answer. He gained fame for the discovery of the theory of relativity instead of Poincaré.
He created the Poincaré Conjecture, one of the most famous problems in mathematics which was only solved 100 years later. He began the branches of mathematics which are known today as chaos theory and topology.
He also wrote about science in a simple way that ordinary people could understand.

Barry George

Barry George (born 15 April 1960) is a British criminal who was wrongly held in prison for 8 years for the murder of journalist Jill Dando. He later had a retrial. His murder conviction and sentence were overturned.
Barry George was born in London in 1960. He is mentally ill and has an IQ of 75. Prior to his trial, he was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and three personality disorders: antisocial, histrionic and narcissistic. When he was young he was a keen roller skater. He once leapt over a line of buses, using a ramp. He used to assume other names, calling himself Paul Gadd (Gary Glitter's real name) and Steve Majors. He also called himself Barry Bulsara and falsely claimed to be Freddie Mercury's cousin. (Mercury was born Farouq Bulsara).
In the early 1980s, he was convicted of impersonating a police officer, attempted rape and indecent assault. In 1983, he was arrested in the grounds of Kensington Palace whilst Prince Charles and Princess Diana were living there. George was carrying a knife, a rope and a poem which he wrote for Prince Charles. He also had photographs of himself in his flat with a mask and guns.
In 2000, he was arrested and charged with murdering Jill Dando. In 2001, he was convicted of the murder, but appealed his sentence. He was retried and found not guilty. Witnesses claimed he could not have killed her at 11.30am, because he was seen 20 minutes later much farther from her house than he could have been. George was released on 1 August 2008. In 2013 it was decided that George would not be given compensation for being put in prison for a murder he did not do.
George now lives in Ballincollig, County Cork.

Toxic assets

The term toxic asset is a nontechnical term used to describe certain financial assets when their value has fallen significantly and when there is no longer a functioning market for these assets, so that they cannot reasonably be sold. This term became common during the financial crisis that began in August 2007. Toxic assets played a major role in that crisis. When the market for such assets ceases to function, it is described as "frozen". 
Markets for some toxic assets froze in 2007, and the problem grew significantly worse in the second half of 2008. Several factors contributed to the freezing of toxic-asset markets. The value of the assets were very sensitive to economic conditions, and increased uncertainty in these conditions made it difficult to estimate the value of the assets. Banks and other, major financial-institutions were unwilling to sell the assets at significantly reduced prices, since lower prices would force them to significantly reduce their stated assets, making them appear insolvent.

Tesseract

A tesseract is a four-dimensional object, much like a cube is a three-dimensional object. A square has two dimensions. You can make a cube from six squares. A cube has three dimensions. The tesseract is made in the same way, but in four dimensions, so it looks different from what a person might expect. 
The tesseract has eight cells; each cell is a cube. The tesseract is one of the six convex regular 4-polytopes. Unlike three-dimensional objects which rotate on both an axis and a plane (the plane being of length and width and the axis being of the leftover dimension, height), a tesseract rotates on two planes, one made up of length and width, and one made up of height and the fourth dimension. It is the simplest hypercube.

Comparison (grammar)

Comparison, in grammar, is a property of adjectives and adverbs.
Adjectives and adverbs take three degrees, such as "kind", "kinder", "kindest". The central degree is comparative, since for example Bill is "kinder than" Joe. whereas the first and third degrees make no comparison. Likewise the use of "more" as in "more quickly" is comparative, where "quick" and "quickest" are not.

Liberal Christianity

Liberal Christianity is a term which is used for several movements in Christianity. These movements formed between the 18th and 20th century. Their philosophical and theological ideas have been influenced by those of Enlightenment. They are not "liberal" in a political sense. They want to remain independent from dogmas defined by the different Christian Churches. When Liberal Christians interpret the Bible, they reject Biblical inerrancy and Papal authority. A Liberal Christian may have certain beliefs that are the same as those of more conservative Christians. Well known proponents include Hans Küng, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and Albert Schweitzer.
Conservative theologians and scholars strongly criticise:' the uncontrollable relativism, pluralism and ultimate nihilism, to which the subjective method of liberal theology was bound sooner or later to give rise'

Jerry Fodor

Jerry Fodor (born 1935) is a philosopher. He mostly works on the philosophy of mind and cognitive science, both of which are concerned with how the mind works. 
His studies have concerned themselves with the idea of whether thought is expressed in language or whether it is absurd to think so. Fodor also attempted to tie in the design of the brain to the thoughts held within. This is described by many as a return to the 19th century practice of phrenology, although Fodor offers more science to back his version up than phrenologists. It is these views which led other philosophers, such as Jared Cole and Daniel Dennett to describe Fodor's claims as absurd and out of date. 
Fodor currently lives in New York City with his wife, Janet. He has two children and several cats. Outside philosophy he enjoys opera and writes for the London Review of Books.

Harry Houdini

Harry Houdini (1874 - 1926) was a Hungarian-American magician and escapologist. He also investigated fake spiritualists and was a skeptic.
He was born in Budapest to Jewish parents and was named "Ehrich Weiss", but changed his name when he became a professional magician. At first he did not have much success in his career. In 1899 his luck changed when he met his manager Martin Beck. Martin Beck was impressed with Houdini's handcuff trick and within a year Houdini was famous, playing big vaudeville shows and touring Europe.
He was a big star in Europe, and they called him "The Handcuff King". After being strip-searched, he still escaped from the worst of tangles. He would free himself from jails, handcuffs, chains, ropes, and straitjackets, often while hanging from a rope in plain sight of street audiences. In 1912, Houdini introduced his most famous act, the Chinese Water Torture Cell, in which he was supposed to be upside-down in a locked glass-and-steel cabinet overflowing with water. He had to hold his breath for more than three minutes. Houdini performed the act for the rest of his career. He once made an elephant disappear. He offered a cash prize to any spiritualist or medium who could prove their supernatural abilities. None could. This called him to fall out with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
Houdini also appeared in several early movies and made many early flights in aeroplanes. He made the first successful aeroplane flight in Australia, on 18 March 1910, at Diggers' Rest, Victoria.
He died in Detroit, Michigan in 1926 from peritonitis after his appendix was ruptured. He was suffering from appendicitis but refused to see a doctor. A student, J. Gordon Whitehead, came to see him and asked if it was true that Houdini could stand being punched in the stomach many times. Houdini said he could, but before he could prepare his stomach the student began to punch him. He later travelled to perform a show. During the show, his appendix burst and Houdini died. Some claim that the appendix would have burst anyway as Houdini refused to see a doctor. He was buried on 4 November 1926. There were over 2000 mourners.

Louis David Riel (22 October 1844 – 16 November 1885, (Loo-E Ree-L) in English) was a Canadian politician. He founded the province of Manitoba and was a leader of the Métis people of the Canadian prairies. He led two resistance movements against the Canadian government and its first Prime Minister, Sir John A. MacDonald. Riel tried to preserve Métis rights and culture. He is regarded by many as a Canadian folk hero today. Until recently, Riel was regarded as an outlaw. During a battle against the Canadian government his people took prisoners. One of these prisoners was a man named Thomas Scott. Scott would often be resistant and disrespectful of his captors. When Scott assaulted one of Riel's men, Riel had had enough. He was put on trial to a jury containing several of Riel's most trusted men. (including Elzéar Goulet, a Métis leader who supported Riel.) The court found Scott annoying, and he was sentenced to death for being mean, by a firing squad. The English speaking people of Ontario considered this murder and a war party called the Wolsely Expedition was sent to put his rebellion down. This, eventually led to his capture. Riel was hanged in Regina due to his involvement in the resistance against the Canadian government.

The Final Solution (German: Die Endlösung) was a plan made by the Nazi Germany to kill millions of Jews and Gypsies (Roma and Sinti people of Romania and many other European countries) during World War II. On July 31 1941, Nazi leader Hermann Goering ordered the SS to make plans for a "complete solution of the Jewish question." At first people were simply shot dead, but in the autumn of 1941 the SS and police began using mobile killing vans. People were locked into the back of trucks which had been changed to allow the exhaust gases such as carbon monoxide to enter. The people sealed in the back of the truck were gassed.
Heinrich Himmler brought in a plan known as Operation Reinhard, named after SS General Reinhard Heydrich, who had been killed by Czech soldiers. Three camps were set up in Poland for the purpose of killing people. These were at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. In 1942 more death camps were set up in Poland at Majdanek, Chelmno, and Auschwitz. By the end of World War II about six million people had been killed.

ISO 8601 is an international standard to describe dates and times in the easiest way possible for computers to understand.
This standard is based on putting the biggest types of numbers first and the smallest numbers last. Because years are bigger than months, and months are bigger than days, they are put in the order of YEAR-MONTH-DAY.
A basic ISO date for today looks like --.

Golden eagle

The golden eagle ("Aquila chrysaetos") is one of the best-known birds of prey in the northern hemisphere. It is the most widely distributed species of eagle. Golden eagles use their agility and speed combined with powerful feet and massive, sharp talons to snatch up prey. They eat hares, rabbits, marmots and other ground squirrels.
Once common across the Holarctic, it has gone from many areas heavily populated by humans. The species is still widespread. It lives in Eurasia, North America, and parts of North Africa.
Like all eagles, it belongs to the family Accipitridae. It is one of the largest birds of prey in North America; only the California condor gets larger. Golden eagles also live in the Scottish Highlands.

Manager (baseball)

A manager is the head coach of a baseball team. His job is to tell the players on the team what to do and make decisions about how the team should play, like who will play in what position. 
In the past, managers were usually players. Since they were players, these managers wore the same uniform as the rest of the team. Managers who were not players, such as Connie Mack, would not be dressed in uniform. Today, managers dress in the same uniform as the team, even though most managers today are not players. Managers in Major League Baseball and for many other teams as well are usually former players themselves. Their playing experience may give them more knowledge on the game that they can use to help their team.

Convex regular 4-polytope

In mathematics, a convex regular 4-polytope (or polychoron) is 4-dimensional (4D) polytope which is both regular and convex. These are the four-dimensional analogs of the Platonic solids (in three dimensions) and the regular polygons (in two dimensions).
These polytopes were first described by the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schläfli in the mid-19th century. Schläfli discovered that there are precisely six such figures. Five of these may be thought of as higher dimensional analogs of the Platonic solids. There is one additional figure (the 24-cell) which has no three-dimensional equivalent.
Each convex regular 4-polytope is bounded by a set of 3-dimensional "cells" which are all Platonic solids of the same type and size. These are fitted together along their respective faces in a regular fashion.
The following tables lists some properties of the six convex regular polychora. The symmetry groups of these polychora are all Coxeter groups and given in the notation described in that article. The number following the name of the group is the order of the group.
Since the boundaries of each of these figures is topologically equivalent to a 3-sphere, whose Euler characteristic is zero, we have the 4-dimensional analog of Euler's polyhedral formula:
where "N" denotes the number of "k"-faces in the polytope (a vertex is a 0-face, an edge is a 1-face, etc.).
The following table shows some 2 dimensional projections of these polytopes. Various other visualizations can be found in the other websites below. The Coxeter-Dynkin diagram graphs are also given below the Schläfli symbol.

Convex set

In Euclidean space, a region is a convex set if the following is true. For any two points inside the region, a straight line segment can be drawn. If every point on that segment is inside the region, then the region is convex.
The point is that a convex curve forms the boundary of a convex set. So, any shape which is concave, or has a hollow, cannot be a convex set.

<doc id="174603" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=174603" title="16-cell">
16-cell

In four dimensional geometry, a 16-cell, is a regular convex polychoron, or polytope existing in four dimensions. It is also known as the hexadecachoron. It is one of the six regular convex polychora first described by the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schläfli in the mid-19th century. 
Conway calls it an orthoplex for "orthant complex", as well as the entire class of cross-polytopes.
The hexadecachoron is a member of the family of polytopes called the cross-polytopes, which exist in all dimensions. As such, its dual polychoron is the tesseract (the 4-dimensional hypercube).
It is bounded by 16 cells, all of which are regular tetrahedra. It has 32 triangular faces, 24 edges, and 8 vertices. The 24 edges bound 6 squares lying in the 6 coordinate planes.
The eight vertices of the hexadecachoron are (±1, 0, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0, 0), (0, 0, ±1, 0), (0, 0, 0, ±1). All vertices are connected by edges except opposite pairs.
The Schläfli symbol of the hexadecachoron is {3,3,4}. Its vertex figure is a regular octahedron. There are 8 tetrahedra, 12 triangles, and 6 edges meeting at every vertex. Its edge figure is a square. There are 4 tetrahedra and 4 triangles meeting at every edge.
There is a lower symmetry form of the "16-cell", called a demitesseract or 4-demicube, a member of the demihypercube family, and represented by h{4,3,3}, and can be drawn bicolored with alternating tetrahedral cells.
One can tessellate 4-dimensional Euclidean space by regular 16-cells. This is called the hexadecachoric honeycomb and has Schläfli symbol {3,3,4,3}. The dual tessellation, icositetrachoric honeycomb, {3,4,3,3}, is made of by regular 24-cells. Together with the tesseractic honeycomb {4,3,3,4}, these are the only three regular tessellations of R. Each 16-cell has 16 neighbors with which it shares an octahedron, 24 neighbors with which it shares only an edge, and 72 neighbors with which it shares only a single point. Twenty-four 16-cells meet at any given vertex in this tessellation.
The cell-first parallel projection of the 16-cell into 3-space has a cubical envelope. The closest and farthest cells are projected to inscribed tetrahedra within the cube, corresponding with the two possible ways to inscribe a regular tetrahedron in a cube. Surrounding each of these tetrahedra are 4 other (non-regular) tetrahedral volumes that are the images of the 4 surrounding tetrahedral cells, filling up the space between the inscribed tetrahedron and the cube. The remaining 6 cells are projected onto the square faces of the cube. In this projection of the 16-cell, all its edges lie on the faces of the cubical envelope.
The cell-first perspective projection of the 16-cell into 3-space has a triakis tetrahedral envelope. The layout of the cells within this envelope are analogous to that of the cell-first parallel projection.
The vertex-first parallel projection of the 16-cell into 3-space has an octahedral envelope. This octahedron can be divided into 8 tetrahedral volumes, by cutting along the coordinate planes. Each of these volumes is the image of a pair of cells in the 16-cell. The closest vertex of the 16-cell to the viewer projects onto the center of the octahedron.
Finally the edge-first parallel projection has a shortened octahedral envelope, and the face-first parallel projection has a hexagonal bipyramidal envelope.

Regular polytope

In mathematics, a regular polytope is the generalisation of the regular polygon. Like other polytopes it may have any natural number of dimensions. For example, a two-dimensional regular polytope is a regular polygon, and a three-dimensional regular polytope is a regular polyhedron. Like with the regular polygon, there are certain kinds of symmetries. Regular polytopes have regular facets (faces to speak from the 3D viewpoint), and their vertex figures are regular.
The simplest of the six convex regular 4-polytopes are the pentachoron and tesseract.

Canadian English is the type of English that is used by Canadians.
It is like American English in terms of vocabulary, but its grammar is like that of British English.
Canadian English is generally taught in schools using British ways of spelling, such as colour, flavour, and so on. However, the word themselves are usually American, in part because Canadians watch a lot of American TV shows and listen to a lot of American pop music. Rarely, the British form of words may be replaced with American forms, such as plow, program, and so on.
The main exception to this rule is terms related to cars and the auto industry. Because Canada's auto industry has always been dominated by American firms, Canadians use American words and spelling for such terms. Canadians and Americans spell the outer rubber portion of a wheel as "tire" instead of "tyre", put "gasoline" or "gas" in their vehicles instead of "petrol", store items in the "trunk" instead of the "boot", and may drive a "truck" instead of a "lorry".
Canadian English is different from other forms of English in its spoken form also. The dialects vary from sounding overtly English to an indistinguishable form very similar to those spoken in the northern states.

It was the result of a protocol signed between Leonese Provincial Government and the Cultural Association for Leonese Language El Fueyu. The celebration is run by the Llión City Council.
Some things that happen during the celebration are a display of traditional Leonese music, as well as the display of some works about Leonese language. There are also books about the Leonese language and Leonese films.
Leonese Language Day started on June 10, 2006. The celebration was organized by the "Asociación Cultural de la Llingua Llïonesa El Fueyu" with the help of the Asociación Berciana en Defensa de la Llingua Llïonesa El Toralín, "La Barda" (Leonese language association from Salamanca) and "Pro Monumenta". There were traditional Leonese musical actuations and it was presented the book in Leonese language "Cuentos del Sil", and several personalities from the cultural, universitary, politic leonese world with young Leonese language students recited poems in Leonese language. It counted with the support of Leonese Provincial Government
This second Leonese Language Day was celebrated on December 16, 2007. The celebration was organized by the Leonese City Council with the help of several associations. At the celebration a documentary called "Asina falamos" was shown, as well as a play called "Fuei a corteixar a Robles".
The third Leonese Language Day was run by the Leonese City Council, with help of several Leonese associations like puntuLLI. That celebration was on December 30. There were meetings about the Leonese Language at the celebration.
At the fourth Leonese Language Day there were musicians like Rodrigo Martínez, Banda de Gaitas, and Ciudá de Llión. During the celebration diplomas were given to the people who done Leonese language lessons in School.

The campaign for reaching a .lli domain started on January 2007 looking for the support of associations and institutions. Between the organizations that support this requirement to the ICANN there are associations about culture, language, sport or nature.
This association promotes the creation of a .lli domain in Internet, according to the ICANN policy of giving Top Level Domains for the languages and cultures. In this sense, puntuLLI promotes a Leonese language and cultural domain.
In 2008 PuntuLLI have collaborated with other initiatives for promoting the Leonese language like an sponsor, specially the Armwrestling World Championship, developed in Llión, the Leonese Country Pipe Bands Championship. 
Leonese City Council selected puntuLLI as official developer of the Internet activities in the III Leonese Language Day.
There are more than 800 people added and 44 organisations that support the campaign, via web, for reaching a Top Level Domain for Leonese language and culture webs.
Actually there are campaigns for reaching TLDs for languages and cultures in Scotland, Wales, Brittany, Galicia, Basque Country, England, Quebec and Cornwall.
Similar campaigns, requesting a TLD for cities, are developed in Berlin, London, New York and Paris.

Travelcard

A Travelcard is a ticket used for most transport in London, including buses and the underground. The ticket is issued by Transport for London and National Rail and can be used on the services of either.
Before Travelcards were used, travellers in Greater London had to pay every time they changed between
London Transport's bus and Underground services. This was a problem as it led to delays while purchasing the next ticket.
One ticket for all transport in London was one of the key promises made in 1981 by the newly-elected Labour Greater London Council, headed by council leader Ken Livingstone. The policy, with the slogan "Just The Ticket", meant that only one ticket was needed for London Transport bus and Underground services. They also reduced the price of transport. The price cut was then ruled illegal, but the one pricing scheme was mostly a success and was extended during the 1980s and 1990s as new transport routes were opened in London.
By 1985, there were two travelcards: the Travelcard itself, which covered only London Buses and the Underground, and the Capitalcard, which covered most bus, Underground and local British Rail (BR) services. The Travelcard replaced the original Capitalcard, while including its greater availability, around 1989.
The original "zonal" system was mainly in Greater London. The zone areas used both letters and numbers for the outermost zones such that bus availability ignored the letter while BR and Underground availability depended also upon the letter(s) - e.g. a Travelcard or Capitalcard valid in zone 3a (but not 3b or 3c) was valid on buses in zones 3a, 3b and 3c but only in zone 3a when used on the railway services.
A Travelcard entitles the holder to use the following modes of transport within Greater London:
Travelcards also entitle the holder to a 33% discount on some London River Services.

Without the credits, the movie is only 57 minutes long.
Stitch, Jumba, and Peakley are all living with Lilo and Nani. But no one knows that Jumba had secretly deactivated all 625 of is other expiriments and brought them with him. The ex-captain Gantu, hired by Jumba's former partner, Dr. Jacques von Hamsterveil, goes to find them, and captures Jumba to force him into telling where they are. Now, Lilo and Stitch have to save Stitch's ohana from being used for chaos. Two expiriemnts are activated in this movie: 221, "Sparky", with the ability to cause big electric surges, and 625 who has all the abilities of Stitch, but is lasier. At least he makes good sandwiches!
The movie's original title was going to be "Lilo & Stitch: A New Ohana". At some time, there was a decision to only have Stitch's name in the names of both the movie and the following series, which was planned to be called "Stitch! The Series". Eventually, this was changed, making this movie and the series have different names.

<doc id="174868" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=174868" title="SS Andrea Doria">
SS Andrea Doria

SS "Andrea Doria" was an Italian ocean liner, or passenger ship. It was owned by a ship line called the Italian Line. It was said to be the biggest, fastest, safest, and most beautiful ship in Italy after World War II. It could carry 1,221 passengers and 563 crew.
The ship was built by the Ansaldo Shipyards in Genoa, Italy. It was launched on June 16, 1951. Its maiden voyage, or first voyage, was on January 14, 1953. Three years later in 1956, it crashed with another ship, MS "Stockholm", in the Atlantic Ocean. At that time, 1,134 passengers and 572 crew were on board. "Andrea Doria" sank in 11 hours, but "Stockholm" survived.
The "Andrea Doria" was the last large ocean liner to sink before airplane travel became popular.
"Andrea Doria" was built at the Ansaldo Shipyards, which was a shipbuilding company in Genoa, Italy. At the time of building, she was:
It was designed for comfort. Its designer was an Italian architect called Minoletti. There was also another ship, "Cristoforo Colombo", that looked exactly like "Andrea Doria".
"Andrea Doria" was a transatlantic ocean liner, which is a ship that crosses the Atlantic Ocean. The ship had three swimming pools, and was the first ship to have that many. Over 1 million dollars were spent on art to decorate the ship.
The ship was also built for safety. It had 11 watertight compartments. These are special dividers in a ship to keep water in one place. If two of them were filled, the ship would not sink. "Andrea Doria" also had very advanced radar. Radar could warn the captain of the Andrea Doria if there was something in the path of the ship. However one big problem was that the ship often tilted too much to one side.
"Andrea Doria" had two rows of lifeboats, which are small boats that can evacuate passengers if the ship sinks. However, if the ship tilted too much, half of the lifeboats could not be used. "Andrea Doria"'s maiden voyage (first voyage) was on January 14, 1953.
"Andrea Doria" sank in the night between July 25, 1956, and July 26, 1956. When she sank, she had 1,134 passengers and 572 crew members, and her captain was Piero Calamai. She was sailing in the Atlantic Ocean. Her path was from Genoa, Italy, to New York, in the United States. "Andrea Doria" entered very thick fog when it passed by Nantucket, which is a small island near Massachusetts. Soon, another ship entered the fog. This was SS "Stockholm". SS "Stockholm" was another passenger ship. Because of the fog, the two ships could not see each other. When they finally noticed each other, they tried to turn away. "Andrea Doria" turned left to pass "Stockholm". But "Stockholm" turned right to try to pass "Andrea Doria". Because of the fog, they could not see what each other was trying to do. At 11:10 PM of July 25, 1956, "Andrea Doria" and "Stockholm" crashed together.
"Stockholm" crashed into the right side of "Andrea Doria" near the middle. It made a large hole that was almost deep. It broke open several of the watertight compartments on "Andrea Doria". It also broke five fuel tanks. The fuel tanks were filled by 500 tons of water. "Stockholm" and "Andrea Doria" separated in 30 seconds. "Andrea Doria" began to tilt to its right side. Soon, half of the lifeboats could not be used, because it was tilting too much. The weight of the fuel tanks that were filled by water also pulled it down. "Stockholm"'s whole front end was destroyed, but it did not sink. 46 passengers on the "Andrea Doria" were killed by the crash. Five crew members of the "Stockholm" were also killed. However, one incredible survivor was Linda Morgan, an "Andrea Doria" passenger who landed on the "Stockholm" when they crashed.
Thirty minutes after the crash, the people on "Andrea Doria" decided to abandon the ship. However, some crew had already left. This made it harder because no crew was there to help. However, there were still enough lifeboats to get everyone out safely. The "SS "Ile de France"", a French ship, arrived at the "Andrea Doria" to help rescue passengers. It launched lifeboats to rescue passengers of the "Andrea Doria". The "Ile de France" had sailed only one day, so it had lots of supplies left to help the passengers of "Andrea Doria". "Andrea Doria" continued to tilt right, and eventually began to sink on 9:45 AM of July 26, 1956. Before that, at 9:00 AM, all the survivors were off the ship. At 10:00 AM, "Andrea Doria" was tilted so far to the right that its windows touched the ocean. At 10:09 AM, the ship sank. This was 10 hours and 59 minutes after it had crashed with the "Stockholm". The back of "Andrea Doria" rose, and its left propeller lifted out of the water. Some lifeboats that were still on the ship broke off and floated away upside down. The ship had drifted 1.6 nautical miles (a measuring distance used at sea) from where it had crashed with the "Stockholm".
A total of six different ships rescued passengers of the "Andrea Doria", including the "Stockholm" and "Ile de France". "Stockholm" was the last to arrive, because it was damaged. Many families had their hopes of seeing loved ones again destroyed. The most affected were those who were meeting members of several families immigrating to the United States in hope of new lives. The Chrysler Norseman, a prototype car headed to New York, was also lost with the other cars aboard "Andrea Doria". A "Rolls-Royce" luxury car was also on Andrea Doria.
A series of lawsuits were filed by both ship lines in response to the disaster. The reasons argued included:
"Andrea Doria" landed on the ocean bottom sideways, with her left side facing up, in good condition. At first, the top of the shipwreck was in water about deep. It was a popular destination for divers. However, the "Andrea Doria" has become a difficult ship to explore. The wreck is at .
More recently, the top part of the ship has collapsed. Inside the ship, many supports have broken. The ship is slowly getting shorter as its weight presses downwards. The top of the wreck is now below the water. Fifteen people have died exploring the "Andrea Doria".
The front of "Stockholm" was eventually fixed. About $1 million was spent. Now, "Stockholm" is named "Athena", and still sails.
Several books have been published about "Andrea Doria". This is a list of some of them:
A memorial wreath was put at the place where "Andrea Doria" sank in July 2002.

Reform

Reform means a useful change, or sometimes to a pure original state.
Reform is generally distinguished from revolution. Revolution means basic or radical change; reform may be no more than fine tuning, or the removing of serious wrongs without changing the whole system. Reform seeks to improve the system as it stands, never to overthrow it.
The UK government frequently uses the term "reform" to describe changes to public services, such as the National Health Service. But these changes are not accepted by all people as useful.
A note about grammar: when used to describe something which is "physically" formed again, such as re-casting it in a mold/mould, or a band that gets back together, the proper term is re-form (with a hyphen), not "reform".

The Battle of Granada was a siege of the city of Granada. It was fought several months and lead to the surrender of Granada on January 2, 1492. The forces of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile fought against the armies of the Muslim Emirate of Granada. 
This relatively small campaign was of enormous consequences because Granada was the last outpost of Al-Andalus in Spain and its fall meant the end of 780 years of Muslim control in the Iberian Peninsula. It also was the last act in the Reconquista, the campaign by the medieval Christian states of Spain to drive out the Moorish invaders.

The Emirate of Granada was established in 1238. As the Reconquista was very successful after the conquest of Cordoba in 1236, the emirate officially became a tributary state in 1238 and was called the Kingdom of Granada. The Nasrid emirs and kings were responsible for building most of the palaces in the Alhambra. The "taifa" became a vassal state of the Christian kingdom of Castile for the next 250 years. The Nasrid sultans and kings paid tribute to the Christian kings and cooperated with them in the battle against rebellious Muslims under Castilian rule. 
On January 2, 1492, the last Muslim leader, Muhammad XII, surrendered complete control of Granada, to Ferdinand and Isabella, after the city was besieged.

Sylvester Stallone

Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone (born July 6, 1946), nicknamed Sly Stallone, is an American actor, director, producer and screenwriter. He was one of the biggest box office draws in the world from the 1970s to the 1990s, Sylvester Stallone is an action hero icon. He has played two famous movie characters: Rocky Balboa, the boxer who overcame challenges to fight for love and glory, and John Rambo, a brave soldier who did violent missions.
Stallone was born in New York City, and he is the son of Frank Stallone, Sr. (born as Francesco Staglione), a hairdresser, and Jackie Stallone (born as Jacqueline Labofish), an astrologer, former dancer, and supporter of wrestling for women. During his birth, doctors used , an instrument that looks like a pair of pincers or tongs, that damaged a nerve and caused paralysis in parts of Stallone's face. The paralysis caused his well known speech and drooping lower lip.
Stallone's grandfather, Silvestro Staglione, was an immigrant from Gioia del Colle, in the province of Bari (Apulia, Italy). Stallone's mother was born in Washington, D.C., and she was the daughter of a Parisian socialite. When Stallone was between the ages of two and five he boarded in Queens, and he only saw his parents on the weekends. In 1951 he went back to live with his parents in Maryland where they owned beauty salons. In 1960s he attended Abraham Lincoln High School (living in the Tacony section of Philadelphia which inspired the Rocky stories) after being rejected for the Catholic High School Father Judge and after that he went to beauty school.
In the 1960s, Stallone stopped going to beauty school after he won a scholarship for the American College of Switzerland in Leysin. There, he studied drama and was well received in school productions. When he went back to America he went to the Theater Arts Department at University of Miami for three years. He came within a few credit hours of graduation before he decided to drop out and try a career at writing screenplays under the pen names Q. Moonblood and J.J. Deadlock. At the same time he started acting in small parts in movies.
Later, Stallone asked that his acting and life experiences be accepted in exchange for his remaining credits, and the President of the University of Miami gave him a Bachelors of Fine Arts (BFA) degree in 1999.
Stallone had his first role in the softcore pornography movie "Party at Kitty and Stud's" (1970), which was later re-released as "Italian Stallion". He was paid US$200 for two days work. An "uncut" version of the movie was released in 2007, and it claimed to show actual hardcore footage of Stallone. However, trade journal "AVN", said that Stallone was not in the hardcore scenes. In 2008, a DVD was released of "White Fire" (1976), a dubbed, German edit of 'Party at Kitty and Stud's', which was alleged to include hardcore footage of Stallone.
Stallone also starred in the play called "Score" which had 23 performances at the Martinique Theatre from October 28 - November 15, 1971. It was later made into a movie by Radley Metzger.
Stallone's other first few movie roles were small, and he did brief appearances that he did not get credit for in Woody Allen's "Bananas" (1971) as a subway thug, in the thriller "Klute" (1971) as an extra dancing in a club, and with Jack Lemmon in"The Prisoner of Second Avenue" (1975), as a young person. In the Lemmon movie, Jack Lemmon chases, tackles and Stallone, thinking that Stallone's character is a thief. He also starred in the hit "The Lords of Flatbush" (1974). In 1975, he played supporting roles in "Farewell, My Lovely", "Capone" and, another hit, "Death Race 2000". He also made guest appearances on the TV series "Police Story" and "Kojak".
Stallone was not very well known by a lot of people until his role in "Rocky" (1976). On March 24, 1975, he saw the Muhammed Ali–Chuck Wepner fight which gave him the idea for "Rocky". That night Stallone went home, and in three days he had written the script for "Rocky". After that, he tried to sell the script with the intent of playing the lead role. Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler both liked the script (which Stallone submitted to them after a casting), and planned on having a star like Burt Reynolds or James Caan to play the lead character. "Rocky" was nominated for ten Academy Awards, this included Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay nominations for Stallone.
The second movie "Rocky II" which Stallone had also written and directed was released in 1979 and also became a huge success. The money it made was over US$200 million.
Apart from the "Rocky" movies, Stallone did many other movies in the late 1970s and early 1980s which were critically acclaimed but were not successful at the box office. He received critical praise for movies such as "F.I.S.T." (1978), a social, narrative styled drama where he plays a warehouse worker who becomes involved in the labor union leadership. In "Paradise Alley" (1978), he plays one of three brothers who is a con artist and who helps his other brother who is involved in wrestling.
In the early 1980s, he starred in a movie with the British veteran Michael Caine in "Escape to Victory" (1981), a sports drama where he plays a prisoner of war involved in a Nazi propaganda fußball (soccer) tournament. Stallone then created the action thriller movie "Nighthawks" (1981), in which he plays a New York city cop who plays a cat and mouse game with a foreign terrorist.
Stallone had another major success when he played as a Vietnam veteran named John Rambo in the action adventure movie "First Blood" (1982). The first chapter of Rambo was both a critical and box office success. The critics praised Stallone's performance, saying he made Rambo seem human despite the way he is described in the book of the same name, "First Blood" and in the other movies. Two other Rambo movies "" (1985) and "Rambo III" (1988) followed (and another, Rambo, in 2008). Although box office hits, the movies were given much less critical praise than the original. He also continued his box office success with the "Rocky" franchise and wrote, directed and starred in two more movies to the series: "Rocky III" (1982) and "Rocky IV" (1985). 
Stallone also unsuccessfully attempted roles in different genres. He wrote and starred in the comedy movie "Rhinestone" (1984) where he played a wannabe country music singer and the drama movie "Over the Top" (1987) where he played a truck driver who enters an arm wrestling competition to impress his estranged son. For the Rhinestone soundtrack, he performed a song. These movies did not do well at the box office and were not well received by critics. It was around 1985 that Stallone was signed to a remake of the 1939 James Cagney classic Angels With Dirty Faces. The movie would form part of his multi-picture deal with Cannon Pictures and he was to co-star with Christopher Reeve. It was going to be directed by Menahem Golan. The re-making of such a very much liked classic was given disapproval by Variety Magazine and horror by top critic Roger Ebert. So, Cannon decided to make Cobra instead. "Cobra" (1986) and "Tango and Cash" (1989) did solid business domestically but overseas they did blockbuster business making over $100 million in foreign markets and over $160 million worldwide. The Rocky and Rambo franchises at the end of the decade were billion dollar franchises internationally.
With the recent success of "Lock Up" and "Tango & Cash", at the start of the 1990s Stallone starred in the fifth installment of the Rocky series "Rocky V" which was considered a box office disappointment and was also disliked by fans because it seemed like an unnecessary movie to the series. It was supposed to have been the last installment in the franchise at the time.
After starring in poorly received "Oscar" (1991) and "Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot" (1992) during the early 90s, he made a big comeback in 1993 with the movie "Cliffhanger" which became an really successful movie making over US$255 million worldwide. Later that year he enjoyed another hit with the futuristic action movie "Demolition Man" which made over $158 million worldwide. His come back success continued with 1994's "The Specialist" (over $170 million worldwide). 
In 1995, he played the comic book based character Judge Dredd who was taken from the well known British comic book 2000 AD in the movie of the same name. The money he made from foregin countries saved the domestic box office disappointment of "Judge Dredd" with a worldwide tally of $113 million. He also appeared in the thriller "Assassins" (1995) with the other stars Julianne Moore and Antonio Banderas. In 1996, he starred in the disaster movie "Daylight" which made only $33 million in the U.S but was a major hit overseas making $126 million, totaling $159,212,469 worldwide.
That same year Stallone, along with an all-star cast of celebrities, appeared in the Trey Parker and Matt Stone short comedy movie "Your Studio and You" commissioned by the Seagram Company for a party celebrating their earning of Universal Studios and the MCA Corporation. Stallone speaks in his Rocky Balboa voice with subtitles translating what he was saying. At one point, Stallone starts yelling about how can they use his Balboa character, that he left it in the past; the narrator calms him with a wine cooler and calls him a "brainiac". In response, Stallone says, "Thank you very much." He then looks at the wine cooler and exclaims, "Fucking cheap studio!"
Following his amazing performance in "Rocky", critic Roger Ebert had once said Stallone could become the next Marlon Brando, although he never received the same critical praise achieved with "Rocky". Stallone did, however, go on to receive much approval for his role in the crime drama "Cop Land" (1997) in which he starred alongside Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta. The movie was only a small success at the box office. His performance led him to win the Stockholm International movie Festival Best Actor Award. In 1998 he did voice-over work for the computer-animated movie "Antz," which made over $90 million domestically.
Stallone starred in the thriller "Get Carter" — a remake of the 1971 British Michael Caine movie of the same name—but the movie was not very well received by both critics and audiences. Stallone's career declined a lot after the movies "Driven" (2001), "Avenging Angelo" (2002) and "D-Tox" (2002). 
In 2000, Stallone received a "Worst Actor of the Century" Razzie award, citing "95% of Everything He's Ever Done" rather than one movie. By 2000, Stallone had been awarded four Worst Actor Razzie awards for individual movies. These include a "Worst Screen Couple" Razzie, and a "Worst Actor of the Decade" Razzie for the 1980s. He had been nominated for the Worst Actor award for nine different years from 1984 to 1992.
In 2003, he played as a villain in the third movie of the Spy Kids trilogy "" which was a huge box office success (almost $200 million worldwide). Stallone also had a small appearance in the 2003 French movie "Taxi 3" as a passenger.
Following several poorly reviewed box office flops, Stallone started to regain fame for his role in the crime drama "Shade" (2003) which was a box office failure but was praised by critics. He was also supposed to star and direct a movie about the murder of rappers Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls, entitled "Notorious", but the movie was not made due to legal issues presented by the 2009 movie of the same name.
In 2005, he was the co-presenter alongside Sugar Ray Leonard of the NBC Reality television boxing series "The Contender". That same year he also made a guest appearance in two episodes of the television series "Las Vegas". In 2005, Stallone also inducted wrestling icon Hulk Hogan, who appeared in "Rocky III" as a wrestler named Thunderlips, into the WWE Hall of Fame; Stallone was also the person who offered Hogan the small part in Rocky "III".
After taking a break from making movies, Stallone made a comeback in 2006 with the sixth and final installment of his successful Rocky series; "Rocky Balboa", which was both a critical and commercial hit. After the critical and box office failure of the previous and presumed last movie "Rocky V", Stallone had decided to end the series with a sixth movie which would be a more appropriate ending to the series. The total domestic box office came to $70.3 million (and $155.3 million worldwide). The budget of the movie was only $24 million. His performance in "Rocky Balboa" has been praised by mostly positive reviews.
When he was asked in February 2008 about which of the icons he would want to be remembered for, Stallone said "it's a tough one, but "Rocky" is my first baby, so "Rocky"."
Stallone worked on "The Expendables", starring, writing, and directing. 
He has said that he wants to adapt the Nelson DeMille novel, "The Lion's Game". He wants to direct a movie on Edgar Allan Poe's life, a script that he has been preparing for years. It has also been been confirmed that he will be making a fifth "Rambo" movie after the success of the fourth one in 2008.
Stallone's first work as a director came in 1978 with "Paradise Alley", which he wrote and starred in. He also directed "Staying Alive" (the sequel to "Saturday Night Fever"), along with "Rocky II", "Rocky III", "Rocky IV", "Rocky Balboa", and "Rambo". Stallone wrote all six "Rocky" films, He also wrote "Cobra", "Driven" and "Rambo." He has co-written several other movies, such as "F.I.S.T.", "Rhinestone", "Over the Top" and the first three Rambo movies. His last major success as a co-writer was with 1993's "Cliffhanger".
Stallone has always been considered a opponent to Arnold Schwarzenegger as an action hero actor. Hints to this have been made in both of their movies. In Schwarzenegger's "Last Action Hero", Stallone is seen as playing the Terminator in a video advertisement in the film's real life. In Stallone's "Demolition Man", there is a futuristic reference to the Arnold Schwarzenegger Presidential Library. Also in the movie "Twins", Arnold Schwarzenegger walks by a giant movie poster for "Rambo III". He glances at the size of Stallone's biceps on the poster, and then he feels his own and laughs at how much smaller Stallone's are. According to both Stallone and Schwarzenegger, despite their on camera "rivalry", they are both very close friends. While promoting the movies "Rocky Balboa" and "Rambo" on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno", Stallone revealed that in the 1980s he and Schwarzenegger looked at each other as "Cain and Abel." Stallone then said that, in the 1990s, he and Arnold became the friends they are today. They became one time business partners in Planet Hollywood.
Stallone has been married three times. At age 28, on December 28, 1974, he married Sasha Czack. The couple had two sons, Sage Moonblood (May 5, 1976 - July 13, 2012) and Seargeoh (b. 1979). His younger son was diagnosed with autism at an early age. The couple divorced on February 14, 1985. The same year his divorce finalized, he married model/actress, Brigitte Nielsen, on December 15, 1985, in Beverly Hills, California. His second marriage lasted two years. In May 1997, Stallone married Jennifer Flavin; he has three daughters with her: Sophia Rose (b. 27 August 1996), Sistine Rose (b. 27 June 1998), and Scarlet Rose (b. 25 May 2002).
Although Stallone is registered as a Republican, he has donated $44,000 to Democratic Party candidates over the years, including $30,000 to the Democratic National Committee, as well as money to the campaigns of Bill Bradley and Joe Biden. However, he has also donated over $33,000 to Republicans over the years and publicly supported John McCain for president in 2008.

Boohbah is also shown in the Netherlands on Nick Jr. "Boohbah" means "doll" in Hebrew, but it is not known if the show was named for this.
The series focuses on the Boohbahs: five plump, fuzzy, furry, round, gumdrop-shaped creatures. They are played by actors in full body costumes. Their on sparkles and shimmers with tiny lights that have big eyes. Their eyebrows are rows of lights. They do not speak; instead, they make noises such as squeaks, squeals, "poofs", and clicks. Each Boohbah is a different color.
A list of the Boohbahs is available below.
The Storypeople are a group of characters who live in Storyland. They are in short stories. They are:
They do not speak. (When Little Dog Fido appears, he gives an "arf!") Though they sometimes show frustration or confusion, the Storypeople rarely, if ever,look upset or sad. The Storyland segments are narrated by actor Chris Langham. In each episode the Storypeople magically receive an object sent to them by a child or group of children.
One of the common things in "Boohbah" is the Boohball. The Boohball, a glowing white ball, is where the Boohbahs live, and it appears out of nowhere in various parts of the show. It travels from country to country when it is called by children. Inside the Boohball is a spinning recharging pod, where the Boohbahs recharge energy. It looks like five deep spoons with the handles linked. One could also say that the hammocks look like five fig halves. The energy is created by the laughter of the children when playing with the Boohbahs, the Boohball, and the Storypeople.

Nuclear and radiation accidents

The list of the worst disasters at nuclear power plants and other nuclear facilities all over the world is presented below:
One of the worst nuclear accidents to date was the Chernobyl disaster which occurred in 1986 in Ukraine. That accident killed 30 people directly, as well as damaging approximately $7 billion of property. A study published in 2005 estimates that there will eventually be up to 4,000 additional cancer deaths related to the accident among those exposed to significant radiation levels. Radioactive fallout from the accident was concentrated in areas of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Approximately 350,000 people were forcibly resettled away from these areas soon after the accident.
Some of the most serious nuclear and radiation accidents by death toll in the world have involved nuclear submarine mishaps. To-date, all of these were units of the former Soviet Union.
Normal Accidents is a 1984 book by Yale sociologist Charles Perrow, which provides a detailed analysis of complex systems from a social sciences perspective. It was the first to characterize complex technological systems such as nuclear power plants according to their riskiness. Perrow says that multiple and unexpected failures are built into society's complex and tightly-coupled systems. Such accidents cannot be designed around.
The inspiration for Perrow's books was the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, where a nuclear accident resulted from an unanticipated interaction of multiple failures in a complex system. The event was an example of a normal accident because it was "unexpected, incomprehensible, uncontrollable and unavoidable".
Perrow's argument rests on three principles. Firstly, people make mistakes, even at nuclear plants. Secondly, big accidents almost always escalate from very small beginnings. Thirdly, many failures are those of organizations more than technology. Each of these principles is still relevant today.
Some of the most serious nuclear and radiation accidents by death toll in the world have involved nuclear submarine mishaps. To-date, all of these were units of the former Soviet Union. Reactor accidents that resulted in core damage and release of radioactivity from nuclear-powered submarines include:

Eastern grey kangaroo

The eastern grey kangaroo ("Macropus giganteus") is a marsupial that lives in south and east Australia, including Tasmania. It is also called the great grey kangaroo and the forester kangaroo. An eastern grey male weighs about 66 kg (145 lb.) and is almost 2 m (6 ft.) tall. Its scientific name, "Macropus giganteus" means gigantic (huge) large-foot, and the eastern grey is the second biggest marsupial on earth. The red kangaroo is the largest. 
Indigenous Australian names for the eastern grey include "iyirrbir" and "kucha". The eastern grey kangaroo was first seen by Europeans when Captain James Cook was fixing his ship near Cooktown, Queensland. He took a sample of this unknown aminal back to England to be examined. The eastern grey is also the kangaroo on the Australian Coat of Arms. Captain John Hunter, later Governor of New South Wales painted a watercolour in 1788, of the eastern grey which was published in his book, "Birds and Flowers of New South Wales, painted on the spot in 1788, 1789 and 1790". This painting can be seen online here.
The eastern grey has a soft grey, or sometimes brown fur. The fur on the chest and stomach is more pale, sometimes white. They have a small head and large ears. Their tails are about long. The male is much larger than the female. They have long eye lashes which protect their eyes from the sun. They live for around 15–20 years. Because they are marsupials, the female carries its young in special pouch. Babies are born about five weeks after mating. The tiny baby which is only about 15 millimetres long, and weighs less than one gram, crawls up into the pouch. Inside the pouch there are four nipples. The baby kangaroo, called a joey, will only use one of the nipples. It lives in the pouch for about eight months. It still drinks milk from its mother until about 18 months of age. The mother is able to have another joey in the pouch, which feeds from a different nipple. The mother provides a different mix of milk to each nipple. A joey can remain with its mother until it becomes an adult, at about four years old.
The eastern grey is the species most commonly seen in Australia. It lives near the big cities of the south and east coast. It likes open grassland with areas of bush for daytime shelter. Like all kangaroos, it is mainly a nocturnal animal, and it is crepuscular, which means it is active early in the morning, and early in the evening. They live in large groups of up to 100 kangaroos, called "mobs'.
The eastern grey is a herbivore, which means it grass and small shrubs. It mainly eats during early morning and evening. They do not need to drink water as they can get enough moisture from the plants that they eat.
The eastern grey kangaroo can travel very fast over land. They can jump up to in a single leap. The fastest recorded speed of any kangaroo was set by a large female eastern grey kangaroo. Kangaroos use less energy if they travel faster. When they go slowly they walk on all four legs, and use their tail as well.
It is often said that kangaroo numbers have increased since the Europen settlement of Australia. There are more areas of grassland and less forest, less dingos, and more man made watering holes. The current population of the species is about two million. Because of this the eastern grey has been killed in some parts of Australia to stop them from eating all the grass and then dying from starvation.

Home on the Range

"Home on the Range" is an American folk song. The lyrics to "Home on the Range" describe life in the Western United States during the 1800s. The song was originally a poem written in fall of 1872 by Brewster Higley titled "My Western Home". Higley was possibly inspired to write the poem from the view outside his log cabin window. The song appeared in the December 1873 issue of "The Smith County Pioneer" under the name "Oh, Give Me a Home Where the Buffalo Roam". The music for "Home on the Range" was composed by Higley's friend, Daniel E. Kelley.
"Home on the Range" became popular in the 1930s. In fact, former president Franklin Delano Roosevelt said "Home on the Range" was his favorite song. In 1947, Kansas adopted "Home on the Range" as their state song.

Cone cell

Cone cells or simply cones are special photoreceptor cells in the retina. They react to light and work best in relatively bright light. 
Cone cells are less sensitive to light than rod cells. Rod cells are more sensitive to light, but cannot tell colors apart. Human eyes usually have different types of cone cells. That way, cones allow the brain to tell colors apart. Their reaction to stimuli is faster than that of the rod cells. For this reason, they can perceive finer details, and more rapid changes in images. 
Humans usually have three kinds of cones, with different photopsins. Each photopsin has different response curves to light, and so responds to color in different ways. This gives trichromatic vision. Being color blind means a lack of one or two types of cone.
In a publication done in 1935, Osterberg thinks that there are about 6 million cone cells in a human eye.

Joni Mitchell

Roberta Joan Anderson (born November 7, 1943 in Fort Macleod, Alberta, Canada), better known as Joni Mitchell, is a Canadian songwriter, musician and artist. Her usual musical instrument is a guitar. Her songs include "Big Yellow Taxi", "Woodstock" (about the 1969 Woodstock Festival), "Free Man In Paris", "Help Me" and "Both Sides Now". Her name Mitchell comes from her first marriage (to Chuck Mitchell).
She first began singing folk music while she attended art school, to earn spending money. In time, her songs and style got her noticed, and she became a professional musician. She signed a recording contract, and her first album appeared in 1968. "Both Sides Now" also boosted the musical career of Judy Collins, another folksinger, whose cover version became a popular hit. She also performs in the contralto range.
Mitchell had romantic relationships with Stephen Stills and David Crosby, both of the band Crosby, Stills & Nash. She also did artwork for one of their album covers. She was scheduled to appear at the Woodstock Festival, as CSN was (joined by Neil Young), but she had to cancel. Her song "Woodstock" still became a hit for CSN, and summed up for many people the meaning of the festival.
During the 1970s, Mitchell changed from folk music to jazz, and she lost some of her fans. Many other people enjoyed her later music, though, including an album she made with Charles Mingus, a legendary jazz musician. The album was Mingus's last project before his death.
Not all of Mitchell's records have been hits, and she resisted compiling a "best-ofs" or "greatest hits" album for many years, feeling that if she did so, her career would be "over". She did finally release a pair of recordings, "Hits" (which contained her biggest hit records) and "Misses" (which included some of her favorite songs, that were not hits). She continues to perform, and to paint pictures. Her paintings are displayed in galleries around the world.
Before she became famous, Mitchell gave up a newborn daughter for adoption in Canada. During the 1990s, the two got back in contact, and now have a good relationship.
Though she first became famous during the 1960s, Mitchell does not that era. She reminds listeners of the negative parts of it, and encourages them to make the present better.
In March 2015, Mitchell was found unconscious in her Los Angeles home. She regained consciousness in an ambulance on her way to hospital, but was taken to intensive care for tests.She had a brain aneurysm. She was diagnosed with a throat tumor later the next day.

Ocean current

An ocean current is a continuous movement of ocean water from one place to another. Ocean currents are created by wind, water temperature, salt content, and the gravity of the moon. The current's direction and speed depend on the shoreline and the ocean floor. They can flow for thousands of miles and are found in all the major oceans of the world. One major example of an ocean current is the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean. 
Ocean currents can be found on the water surface and deeper down.

Wikipedia:Simple talk/Archive 61

Ok all, I very hardly ever speak freely about what is on my mind, but this is just one of those times that I cannot just let what I am thinking or what is on my mind from being said. As a precaution, I am going to tell you that I am speaking my mind as my mind is speaking it to me, and that it might offend someone (although I'll try not to offend anyone). Ok, now that we have that down, here is what I have to say:
The Simple English Wikipedia is heading down the wrong path. Some of our core processes are broken and yet we would rather discuss what the "icon"s look like on both the GA and VGA pages. Here is what I have to say about this: This is utter crap! We need to stop worrying about how the icons look and start worrying more about how our VGA and GA processes work because frankly, they are broken and are in need of a major fixup. Therefore, I think that all changes to our icons should be reversed back to the way that they were before we started heading down the wrong path and we need to start discussing how to change/fix the VGA and GA processes so that they aren't broken anymore. 
People have been saying how many active editors have been retiring from here lately, and personally, I agree with the people that have left. Simple is broken and needs to be fixed. They left because they did not like the path that the Simple English Wikipedia is heading down and frankly, I don't either. Would you rather continue to have more and more of our most active users stop editing here because of the many unnecessary changes to the Simple English Wikipedia, or would you rather have us keep our most active editors. I am sick and tired of our most active editors stopping editing here and I am sick and tired of the way that this Wikipedia is run. We need to fix the way that this Wikipedia is run, and fast, otherwise, you will lose one of your most valued editors. I will retire in a month if we do not make major headway on this problem, and this time, I absolutely mean it. I will retire in a month if we do not fix our problems, and I am sure that many other active editors here will also retire when I retire because frankly, I think that I am the reason why some of our most active editors are still here.
If we do not turn the Simple English Wikipedia around and we do not turn it around fast enough, I doubt that we will be around much longer. If I do not think that we are going to get any better, I might just have to propose the closure of this Wikipedia as a failure. 
Simple talk is also turning into a cesspool. We need to start having our discussions here more civilly and we need to start making longer discussions have their own pages to talk about them on. Simple Talk is just the cesspool for every single thing to talk about on here, and this needs to be fixed. I propose that we start having longer discussions on a subpage of this page, like Wikipedia:Simple talk/Proposal to add images for example. Otherwise, this page just gets clogged with too much "useless" information and people have to scroll down to get to the useful posts here.
This is your last warning Simple English Wikipedia! We need to get our ship turned around and start heading in a more positive way before we get closed for good. 03:51, 24 March 2009 (UTC)
"I will retire in a month if we do not fix our problems, and I am sure that many other active editors here will also retire when I retire because frankly, I think that I am the reason why some of our most active editors are still here." Oh do go away and put that theory to the test, then, and stop creating drama. Thanks,  () 10:31, 24 March 2009 (UTC)

Hello all,
we have two long discussions above, saying that SEWP in its current form is not what it should be. This may be very true, but I believe in solutions, rather than talking things to death.
Here are a few suggestions:
Some of the last few articles I listed probably need a lot of work (I am thinking of Jesus, listed for VGA). I also believe in making controversial subjects into better quality articles. While this is more difficult to do, it shows that even a small community like ours is capable of producing high-quality articles. Anyway, these are ramblings. -- () 10:50, 24 March 2009 (UTC)

"This discussion was originally ."
I propose we get rid of this line from the "What the Simple English Wikipedia is not" section that reads:
"Instead, we write about the most common subjects so that people from every language can read the pages easily."
because we shouldn't limit ourselves to the most common subjects. Just about every subject English Wikipedia covers could be cover in a Simple English way. The people also just learning English or kids also deserve to know just as much information, or in other word, as much information as possible. Opinions?--    08:06, 4 January 2009 (UTC)
Hi, I've made a comment at if anyone wants to discuss. It's about formalizing the QD'ing of hoaxes. 23:02, 24 March 2009 (UTC)
I'm going to start working on the articles linked under "Knowledge groups" on the main page to get them all up to GA or VGA. I think it's not good that most of these are not sourced, have complex language and are generally lacking as articles. I'd invite others to join me and we can get this done within a couple of weeks. Our main page and the articles linked to it should/must be our "showcase". It should be an example of our best work. I'd suggest that the Article Improvement Drive take on this min-project also. I'm going to start with architecture myself. Cheers 00:09, 25 March 2009 (UTC)

Why are we rushing to elect a "Committee" so fast, when we haven't properly discussed if the idea of a committee is any good. Personally, I think it's a terrible idea, I somewhat see it as power grabbing, and not something we need. We can discuss things properly, evaluate articles and determine whether they are good or very good, depending on the criteria, and not relying on votes. 00:33, 12 March 2009 (UTC)
To me, it sounds a bit aristocratic oligarchic. I would like a say in the PVGA and PGA processes. I don't think my ideas are completely useless. A committee would be fine if we had some number of editors volunteer their time. The only thing is, they would have to be committed to the committee. I wouldn't support the proposal at all, but if we were doing that, I would choose it to be of any number of committed users. I personally would like to be a part of this "committee", seeing as I participate regularly in the said processes. Cheers, 03:03, 25 March 2009 (UTC)
"What do you want done next in the PGA/PVGA process?"
Hello all,
I've been doing some thinking, along with others, and now that we have lost DYK we have lost all forms of showing off our "Good Articles", or "GAs".
I'd like to propose that DYK is revived, but in a different form that is not user intensive and once set up can simply be "run".
I propose that it is used soley for showing GAs, and two or three facts from eachGA are put into a fixed queue. This queue is then randomised so that three or four hooks show at once, and the hooks displayed on the main page are never fixed, so that they (literally) change with every page load.
Thoughts?
What if we cycled it, much like the VGA? -- 05:03, 24 March 2009 (UTC)
What if we revived the DYK and cycled all of the GAs in a mod format, much like the selected articles are cycled? In the end, the article's hooks may be repeated, but it seems like nobody has a problem with the selected articles' being repeated. Officially consider this Proposition 3. 04:01, 25 March 2009 (UTC)
<-- Ahh, but that is my point, it would not actually be a single editor approving it. The first "check" is when the nominator nominates it; the second "check" occurs when an editor reviews it and approves it; the third "check" is a different editor who moves it into the next update template section. That's actually three editors reviewing a single hook, not just one. If we cycled old hooks to make up the numbers we'd use old hooks in a oldest first manner. We wouldn't use the same hook over and over again. I think that DYK hooks should be from anywhere; VGA, GA, PVGA, PGA, stubs, whatever. As long as they are sourced, why not. Even VGAs should be used because it'd encourage the reader to look into VGAs that are not the current FA. I personally only think that DYK should be updated once a week, more often is too much for us as a community to handle. ' " 23:10, 25 March 2009 (UTC)
So, I am requesting that the has a WP shortcut, because, the Typo Team has already 19 members plus one "honorary" member. -- 00:40, 24 March 2009 (UTC)
CM16, your project is unfinished, and it has like what, 4 people, 2 of which are not active, and 1 whose computer crashed. You won't be getting a shortcut anytime soon. The typo team shortcut proposal is more reasonable, though. 18:22, 24 March 2009 (UTC)

Am I the only person who finds it hard to see the difference between the PGA and the GA icons? This is dangerous as people not so familiar with Wikipedia may mistake a PGA (which could be a terrible state) with a GA (which hopefully won't). I think the older icons which were darker in colour and showed the "chipped" edge for proposed GAs and VGAs were much clearer. () 15:17, 26 March 2009 (UTC)
I've gone ahead and was and I have changed the icons to a compromise between the two design ideas. I believe that this design for both the GA and VGA icons provides both the "roundness" of TOM's design with the professionalism of the old designs. I believe that it is a good middle ground for both sides. What do you think? 16:18, 26 March 2009 (UTC)
Hey all,
Need a bit of help with . It's not displaying correctly on Bush Hill Park railway station and I doubt it will on every other page it is placed on. Cheers, 18:24, 26 March 2009 (UTC)
I'm personally quite disappointed that some people (who shall remain unnamed) are reverting templates such as , , , and to how it was before I changed it to the icon, calling it "nonsense". Yet in the vote that I held for Proposition 1 (possibly the most controversial proposition I've ever made), it was firmly established by a vote of 11-3 that I should do an overhaul. Now, it seems that some people who didn't vote because it was "nonsense" are complaining, and some people who did vote are bummed and angered that it got the votes and are taking it into their own hands to revert my changes. Please stop. This may turn into an edit war, and I'm saying it here, on Simple Talk, to please not revert my changes when the community established in the vote that they thought it was a good idea. I don't want to keep bringing this up, but I will have to as long as people keep doing this. 20:03, 26 March 2009 (UTC)
My two cents: I would much rather have the icons be something that looks professional and would give the readers of the articles the impression that we actually care about or VGAs and GAs. The stars that TOM changed our icons to are not professional (IMHO), and do not give our readers the sense of professionalism that we should be showing to our readers. Heck, that might even get those readers to join our site! I understand that TOM went through a lot of work into making the icons, however, I do not think that those icons are the way to go. I believe that the icons that I changed them to were much better and as Djsasso brought up above, the symbols need to be different for our color blind editors to be able to differentiate between GAs and VGAs. I believe that I accomplished that. Thanks for hearing me out, 20:30, 26 March 2009 (UTC)

Immortal game

The Immortal Game was a chess game played on 21 June 1851 by Adolf Anderssen and Lionel Kieseritzky. The number of pieces Anderssen gave up in order to win have made it one of the most well known chess games of all time. Anderssen gave up both rooks and a bishop, then his queen, checkmating his opponent with the remaining bishop and two knights.

<doc id="175149" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=175149" title="Bruno Walter">
Bruno Walter

Bruno Walter (pronounce: "Valter"), (born Berlin, 15 September 1876; died Beverly Hills, California, 17 February 1962) was a German-born conductor, pianist and composer. He was one of the greatest conductors of his time. He grew up in Germany, but later became an Austrian and, when the Nazis came to power, he moved to several other countries, finally settling in the United States where he became an American citizen. His name was originally Bruno Schlesinger but from 1896 he was usually known as Bruno Walter. Walter became his official surname in 1911 when he became an Austrian citizen.
Bruno was born into a Jewish family in Berlin. He had his early musical education at the Stern Conservatory when he was eight, and played the piano in public when he was nine. He went to concerts which were conducted by the great Hans von Bülow. Two years later, in 1891, he heard Wagner operas in Bayreuth. These experiences made him want to be a conductor.
Bruno started his conducting career at the Cologne Opera in 1894. Later that year he went to the Hamburg Opera to work as a chorus director. There he met and worked with Gustav Mahler, from whom he learned a lot. Mahler found him a job conducting at the opera house in Breslau. This is when he changed his name from Schlesinger (meaning: “someone from Silesia”) to “Walter”. He then went to Riga, returning to Berlin in 1900 where he conducted at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden where he worked with famous people such as Richard Strauss and Karl Muck.
In 1901 Mahler invited Walter to be his assistant at the Court Opera in Vienna. At his first performance he conducted Verdi's "Aida". He was becoming very famous all over Europe. He performed in Prague and in London where in 1910 he conducted "Tristan und Isolde" and Ethel Smyth's "The Wreckers" at Covent Garden. A few months after Mahler's death in 1911, Walter led the first performance of "Das Lied von der Erde" in Munich, as well as Mahler's Symphony No. 9 in Vienna the next year.
Walter became an Austrian citizen in 1911, but two years later he went to Germany to become the Royal Bavarian Music Director in Munich. The next year Walter conducted his first concert in Moscow. He continued to conduct during First World War, conducting operas by composers including Erich Korngold and Hans Pfitzner. Among his friends in Munich was Eugenio Pacelli who later became Pope Pius XII.
Walter left Munich in 1922 and went to New York the next year. He conducted the New York Symphony Orchestra in Carnegie Hall. He later conducted in Detroit, Minnesota and Boston. 
When he returned to Europe, Walter was invited to play in many places, including Berlin Leipzig, Milan (La Scala) and London, where he was chief conductor of the German seasons at Covent Garden from 1924 to 1931. 
In the late 1920s, the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler often complained that conductors at the Berlin opera were Jews. He often talked about Walter, adding that his real name was “Schlesinger”. When the Nazis came to power in 1933 Walter left Austria. He often conducted the Concertgebouw Orchestra and was invited to conduct concerts in New York with the New York Philharmonic. When the Nazi’s took power in Austria (the Anschluss) Walter was conducting in Paris. France offered Walter French citizenship. His daughter was in Vienna. She was arrested by the Nazis, but Walter managed to persuade them to free her.
On 1 November, 1939, he sailed to the United States where he lived for the rest of his life. His home was in Beverly Hills, California. Many people who lived there had fled from Europe because of the Nazis. They became his friends. They included the German writer Thomas Mann. He worked with many famous American orchestras, including the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the NBC Symphony Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra. After the war he often came back to Europe. He performed at the Edinburgh Festival and in Salzburg, Vienna and Munich. In his later life he made many stereo recordings with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra. He made his last live concert appearance on 4 December, 1960 with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and pianist Van Cliburn. His last recording was a series of Mozart overtures with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra at the end of March in 1961. Bruno Walter died of a heart attack in his Beverly Hills home in 1962.
Between 1923 and 1961 Walter made hundreds of recordings. The earlier recordings, made at a time when his conducting was at its best, are often rather poor recordings. When he made his last recordings, after stereo records had been invented, he was already quite ill. In his early years he gave some of the first performances of Mahler’s music. He conducted the first performance of "Das Lied von der Erde" with the Vienna Philharmonic. In 1936 he made the first recording of the same work with the same orchestra which still had the same leader: Arnold Rosé who was Mahler’s brother-in-law. This recording was made just before the Nazi Anschluss which forced Walter and Rosé into exile. Many years later, in 1952, Walter and the Vienna Philharmonic once again made a famous recording of "Das Lied von der Erde" with the singers Kathleen Ferrier and Julius Patzak. He also recorded Mahler’s Ninth Symphony. Since Walter had worked closely with Mahler, and Mahler had never conducted either of these two great works of his, we can imagine that Walter’s recordings show us how Mahler might have wanted the music to be played.
Walter made many recordings of other great Germanic composers, such as Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Johannes Brahms, Johann Strauss II., and Anton Bruckner.
Walter was known as a kind, modest man, quite unlike some other conductors of the time who behaved like dictators. He was an excellent pianist and sometimes accompanied singers such as Kathleen Ferrier at recitals. He also composed several works. He wrote an autobiography called “Theme and Variations”.

Karl Muck

Karl Muck, (his first name is sometimes spelt Carl, his surname rhymes with “book”) (born Darmstadt, 22 October 1859; died Stuttgart, 4 March 1940) was a German conductor. He was one of the greatest conductors of his day, especially famous for his conducting of operas by Richard Wagner.
Karl Muck’s father was a Bavarian politician and amateur musician. After his school years he studied music at the Conservatory in Würzburg. He also studied classical philology at the University of Heidelberg. In 1877 he continued his music studies in Leipzig, learning the piano with Carl Reinecke. His first public performance was in 1880, the year in which he graduated with a doctorate, playing the piano in the Piano Concerto by Xaver Scharwenka at the Leipzig Gewandhaus.
Soon he spent all his time conducting operas. He conducted in Zürich, Salzburg, Brno and Graz, and got a conductor’s job in Prague and later in Berlin. He conducted the operas of Wagner’s Ring Cycle with great success as well as many performances of "Parsifal". In 1912 he became the conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and from 1922 until he retired in 1933 he conducted the Hamburg Philharmonic Orchestra. 
Muck was one of the first conductors to be internationally famous for travelling about conducting orchestras in many parts of the world. He was a strict conductor who thought it was very important that the players should do exactly what the composer asks for in the score.
He was imprisoned in the United States during World War I, because of his support for Germany and because he refused to conduct the "Star Spangled Banner". After the war he was sent away and not allowed to return to America. After his death a square in Hamburg was named after him, although in 1997 it was renamed “Johannes Brahms Square” because Muck had praised Adolf Hitler.

A town square is a large open area in the centre of a town. Town squares were traditionally places where people came together to meet, or to sell and buy things, or to be entertained. They often had markets, or they were used for concerts. They are often surrounded by shops or cafés.
Other names for town square are civic center, city square, urban square, market square, public square, Platz (from German), plaza (from Spanish), piazza (from Italian), and place (nearly rhymes with “bus”) (from French). 
Many town squares in the 20th century became used as car parks. In recent years cars have been banned from some town squares so that people can enjoy the open space once more, free from traffic and pollution.
In other parts of towns there are often smaller open spaces which are called “squares”. They are often square in shape, but some are different shapes.
Some famous squares include: Red Square in Moscow, Beijing's Tiananmen Square in Beijing, Times Square in New York City and Trafalgar Square in London.

Torture in the United States includes cases of torture reported in the United States and outside the USA by U.S. government workers. 
The United States and other countries involved in the War on Terror have used torture to get information from suspected terrorists. Some of the most well known cases of torture involving the U.S. are the Abu Ghraib scandal and Guantanamo Bay. 
Starting in 2004 there were reports of abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The New Yorker newspaper had an article in May 2004 about the abuse and the article had pictures that were taken by soldiers involved. According to an investigation by the Department of Defense called the Taguba Report, the military had been looking into the abuse since 2003. In the end nine soldiers were discharged from the military and sent to prison.
Human rights organisations like Amnesty International have said CIA agents used waterboarding and other ways to get information out of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. Because of the abuse President Barack Obama ordered the base to be closed down.

Fiat money

Fiat money is legal tender, or currency (bank notes and coins), which has value only because a government says so, and because the people using it maintain faith in it having value. Fiat money such as US dollars can be used as an exchange for goods and services.
The point is that other kinds of money have been used. Fiat money differs from commodity money and representative money. Commodity money is based on a "good", often a precious metal such as gold or silver, which is desired or has other uses. Representative money is a claim on the commodity rather than the actual good. In that case, the gold stays in a bank, and its ownership changes from time to time as the money is used. Why might a good be used at all? One reason is that governments cannot just make it. It is said that this stops inflation because, with fiat money, governments can just print more.
Some economists argue that an economy can only grow if it can produce more capital goods and not more money in the form of credit. This means that good economies must produce things rather than borrow money to buy things produced in other countries.
Alan Greenspan was an early critic of fiat money arguing that "Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth". He thought the value of money should be backed by gold.

The words anal-retentive (or anally retentive, anal retentive), often shortened to "anal", are used in everyday language to describe a person with so much attention to detail that the obsession becomes annoying to other people. The idea was thought up by Sigmund Freud 
In the psychology ideas of Freud, the anal stage is said to follow the oral stage of development in babies and young kids. This is usually when they are learning toilet training. Freud made a theory which said that children who experience troubles during this time may develop "anal" personality traits, as well as a general interest in collecting and keeping things.
Although Freud's theories have been influential, research suggests patterns of parental attitudes has a major effect on how a baby will grow up.

San Joaquin River

The San Joaquin River is one of the two major rivers of California, in the United States. At long, it is the second longest river in California, after the Sacramento River. It begins on the west Sierra Nevada Mountains and flows west and north to its end at San Francisco Bay, at the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. 
Its basin, which is about 32,000 square miles (82,879 square kilometers) in size, contains mostly farmland. The river provides drinking water to over 22 million California citizens. Its three largest tributaries are the Merced, Tuolumne, and Stanislaus rivers.
The river was once one of the richest river ecosystems in California. However, now over of the river is dry except during floods, because lots of water has been taken away for irrigation. In fact, below Friant Dam, a dam built in the 1940s on the San Joaquin River, 95 percent of the river's flow is dry. Much of the river is polluted, destroying the historic population of chinook salmon, once the southernmost in the United States. Pesticides, selenium, and many more toxic materials are carried by the San Joaquin into San Francisco Bay.
Now, one of the largest projects in the American West has been begun to restore the San Joaquin River. On September 13, 2006, the Natural Resources Defense Council signed an agreement with Friant Dam users and the United States Department of the Interior. This agreement would restore the San Joaquin River below the dam, reducing pollution.
Three forks of the San Joaquin River join to form the San Joaquin River at two places, called "Balloon Dome" and "Junction Butte". 
The river continues west into the Central Valley of California, and is joined by many other rivers flowing off the Sierra Nevada mountains. The most largest of these are the Stanislaus River, Tuolumne River, and Merced River. The Tuolumne and Merced river both flow out of Yosemite National Park. 
As the river flows north and west, it is joined by the following tributaries:
The San Joaquin River and its tributaries pass through/feed the following lakes and reservoirs:
Several man-made channels are also part of the river system:
The San Joaquin River eventually meets the Sacramento River, forming the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This is one of the biggest estuaries in the United States. It is near the city of Antioch. At this place, the San Joaquin River splits into two rivers: the "Old River" and the "Middle River". The Old River sometimes confuses fish to go down its channel. As a result, a wall is built between the San Joaquin River and the Old River.
Before humans began to develop the Central Valley in the 1850s, the San Joaquin River and its surrounding lands were one of the richest biological habitats in California. In winter, the river would flood the valley, leaving behind wetlands. These wetlands became rich habitat for birds and other animals. The habitat of the endangered "San Joaquin Kit Fox" and the "riparian brush rabbit" also was near the San Joaquin River. 
In 1942, a big dam, Friant Dam, was built on the San Joaquin River. This dam took away a lot of water from the river, to irrigate crops, provide drinking water, and provide electricity. The dam destroyed the salmon habitat in the river, and also destroyed the creation of these wetlands. 
The Friant Dam is:
The San Joaquin River has been used a lot for shipping of products via boats and ships, otherwise known as navigation. The river was first used for navigation during the California Gold Rush of 1849. Boats carried people over up the river to look for gold in the mountains. Now, there is a channel that runs all the way upriver to the city of Stockton. This channel allows big ships to sail in the river up to this point. Sediment, however, has clogged a lot of the river channel above this point, preventing big ships from going any farther.

The Hudson Valley is a valley of the Hudson River. It runs from about Westchester County to Albany.
The Hudson River valley runs in a north-south direction across eastern New York State. There are many rock types in the valley. This includes Triassic sandstones and redbeds in the south, and the Palisades Sill. Older Precambrian gneiss is in the north (and east). 
In the Hudson Highlands, the river enters a fjord. This fjord was cut during previous ice ages. To the west are the very long Appalachian highlands. Near Tappan Zee Bridge, the west side of the river has high cliffs. They are about 400–800 feet high.
Most of the Hudson Valley is part of the Appalachian Mountains. The northern part of the Hudson Valley is part of the Great Lakes area.
During the last ice age, the valley was filled by a large glacier. The glacier went down as far as Long Island. Near the end of the last ice age, the Great Lakes drained south down the Hudson River. The drained water is called Lake Iroquois. Lake Ontario is the remnant of that lake.

Central Valley

The Central Valley (also called the Great Central Valley) is a very large valley in the middle of California, in the United States. About 42,000 square miles (108,779 square kilometers) in size, it is about the size of the state of Tennessee. It consists of two connected, differently named valleys, the "Sacramento Valley" and the "San Joaquin Valley".
The Sierra Nevada Mountains border the valley on the east side, while the Coast Range borders it on the west side. The Sacramento River flows through the north part of the Central Valley. This part of the valley is also called the "Sacramento Valley". The San Joaquin River flows through the larger south part of the Central Valley. also called the "San Joaquin Valley". Both rivers merge eventually and empty into the Pacific Ocean via San Francisco Bay. 
The capital of California, Sacramento, is located in the north part of the Central Valley. In total, the Central Valley is around long.
The Central Valley has 18 California counties. 15 of these counties are among the 25 most productive farmland in California. Overall, the Central Valley economy depends on farming. However, this has led to serious environmental damages, such as pesticides and selenium and other bad materials being washed into the rivers and polluting the San Francisco Bay.
The valley floor is a flat, smooth land area covering about 42,000 square miles (108,779 square kilometers) in size, long, and wide. It covers 18 California counties. These counties are:
-from north to south.
The Sierra Nevada mountains are on the east side of the valley. These mountains are very tall and steep. Lots of rivers and streams flow off the Sierra Nevada. The highest mountain in the Sierra Nevada is Mount Whitney (14,495') which is also the tallest mountain in California and the rest of the United States (except for Alaska and Hawaii). On the west side, there is the California Coast Ranges, an extension of the Pacific Coast Ranges. Its highest point is approximately 8,848'.
The Sacramento River begins in the north part of the Central Valley, near Mount Shasta. It actually begins in the Cascade Range, which are mountains north of the Central Valley, though most of its length is in the Central Valley. The Sacramento River flows south about to San Francisco Bay. Some of its tributaries include the Pit River, Feather River, and American River. All these rivers come off the Sierra Nevada.
The San Joaquin River begins at the south Sierra Nevada, and flows west and north into the Central Valley and to San Francisco Bay. Altogether, its length is sone . The San Joaquin is more polluted than the Sacramento, and about of it is actually dry.
Together, the Sacramento-San Joaquin river system is the water supply of 22-23 million people in California.
The climate of the Sacramento Valley (north Central Valley) and San Joaquin Valley are very different. The Sacramento Valley has a "Mediterranean climate". This means that it has warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The San Joaquin Valley is much hotter and drier. Most of it is "Mediterranean steppe", which is similar to Mediterranean except that it is warmer and drier. Some of it, however, can be close to desert climate. This section of the Central Valley is said to have the worst air quality in California.
The Central Valley is home to about 6.5 million people. The ten largest cities in or near the valley are, by population:
However, since most of the land area of the Central Valley is devoted to farming, the population density (amount of people divided by land area) is actually quite low. The population density of the Central Valley is 155 people per square mile (60 people per square kilometer). In contrast, the population density of Los Angeles, the biggest city in California, is 25,904 people per square mile.
Farming (agriculture) has always been the main economy of the Central Valley. Except for the city of Sacramento, where the focus is on the government, the rest is mostly agricultural. Immigrants provide a large amount of the work done in farms in the Central Valley. Overall, 12.3% of jobs in the Central Valley are directly agriculture related. Not including Sacramento County, the percentage is 16%.
The main road transport routes through the Central Valley are Interstate 5 and California State Route 99. These two highways run from north to south. Interstate 5 is the larger of the two, and carries more traffic. Highway 99 is older than Interstate 5. The Highway 99 separates from Route 5 at the south end of the Central Valley, and joins again at the north end of the valley.
The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF) and the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) go through the Central Valley as well. Some of their branch lines include:
Amtrak is one of the main rail service providers in the Central Valley, and is also popular in much of the rest of California.
The 715-mile (1,150 km) California Aqueduct, the longest aqueduct in California, runs through the Central Valley. Water from the northern Central Valley and the Sierra Nevada goes into this aqueduct. The Central Valley Project is another major water supply project in the Central Valley. This project includes:

Tributary state

A tributary state is a state that is subordinate to a more powerful neighbour. It was a form of subordination in pre-modern times.
The tributary sent a regular token of submission to the superior power. This was a tribute, a substantial gift of wealth, such as the gold, produce, or slaves. The tribute might best be seen as the payment of protection money. But there were other ways to show submission as well.
For modern forms of state subordination, see puppet state, satellite state and client state.

The Alhambra (from Arabic = Al-Ħamrā', literally "the red one"; the complete name was = al-Qal'at al-Ħamrā' = "the red fortress") is a palace and fortress complex of the Moorish rulers of Granada in southern Spain (known as "Al-Andalus" when the fortress was constructed during the mid 14th century), occupying a hilly terrace on the southeastern border of the city of Granada. 
In the Middle Ages the Alhambra was the residence of the Muslim rulers of Granada and their court, now it is one of Spain's major tourist attractions. There one can see the most famous Islamic architecture of the country. Within the Alhambra, the Palace of Charles V was erected by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1527. 
The Muslim rulers lost Granada and Alhambra in 1492 without the fortress itself being attacked when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile took the surrounding region with an overwhelming force of numbers.

Separately managed account

A Separately Managed Account or SMA is a type of financial investment account popular with some individual investors. SMAs are offered by financial consultants and brokerage firms, and managed by independent "money managers." A money manager is simply a business that manages stock and other securities portfolios or baskets of investments for an investor. SMAs have varying fee structures. Common characteristics of SMA programs are: they provide open investment choices; have multiple managers; and, offer a customized investment portfolio created for a client's specific needs. By customizing the portfolio, investors can limit the investment risk with various strategies, such as using stock options, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
SMAs were first introduced in the US in the 1970s by the former investment firm EF Hutton Since that time, SMAs have grown in popularity, are offered in the US, UK, Australia and other countries. For some investors, Separately Managed Accounts are rivals to mutual funds and other types of investments. 
While there is no long-term research that compares SMAs’ performance to that of mutual funds or other investment categories, the available research does show them as a strong competitor.
Morningstar Inc., a fund research firm, released research that showed that SMAs beat mutual funds in 2008. Morningstar said that SMAs outperformed mutual funds in 25 of 36 stock and bond market categories that year. In addition, Morningstar said that from 2006 to 2008, SMAs surpassed mutual funds in 22 of 26 categories. 
"The Wall Street Journal" reported that Separately Managed Accounts may beat popular mutual funds because SMAs “…tend to have smaller amounts of assets than popular mutual funds, allowing them to trade more nimbly." 
Unlike mutual funds, SMAs permit the investor to tailor their basket of stocks and bonds which can limit the investment risk. "Registered Rep", an investment trade magazine, said that SMAs also can provide 
tax advantages that may not be available with mutual funds and other investments. 
The "Wall Street Journal" recognized top SMA performers including PTI Securities & Futures LP’s “Protected Index Program” and Robinson Value Management Ltd’s “Market Opportunity Composite Strategy.” 
"Pensions & Investments", a US investment trade magazine, reported on several of the highest performing SMAs for 2008.
Financial experts point out that past performance of any investment is not a predictor of future performance. So, investors should talk with a licensed financial adviser and carefully review all information available before making any investment decision. In addition, before making an investment, investors should check with the appropriate licensing and regulatory authorities to ensure that the firm(s) offering SMAs is (are) properly licensed and in good standing.

"Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo" is a sentence that uses correct grammar. It is often used as an example of how homonyms and homophones can be used to create complicated constructs. The sentence means "The bison from Buffalo confuse other bison from Buffalo who confuse the bison from Buffalo." 
It has been talked about since 1967, when the sentence was used by Dmitri Borgmann in his book "Beyond Language". Later, in 1972, the sentence was used by William J. Rapaport. Rapaport is a professor at the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, New York.
The sentence does not have punctuation. It uses three different meanings of the word "buffalo". They are:
It can be broken down to "Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo", where "a" is adjective, "n" is noun, and "v" is verb.
Other words can be used to make sentences like this one. These include "police", "fish", and "people". For example, "Fish fish fish fish fish". Other times, similar words that are spelled differently can be used: "Foul fowl foul fowl foul foul foul fowl".

Its name comes from the Thai language's "Mae Num", or literally, "Mother Water". 
The Mekong is one of the most biologically diverse areas in the world, with hundreds of types of fish, as well as river dolphins, crocodiles, and otters. Indeed, fishing is a very important activity on the river. However, the Mekong River is also used extensively for navigation, and has many dams along its length.

Taifa

A taifa (from "ṭā'ifa", plural طوائف "ṭawā'if") was an independent Muslim-ruled principality. Taifas developed during the history of Iberia. They were usually emirates or little kingdoms, but there was one oligarchy as well. A number of taifas formed in the Al-Andalus (Moorish Iberia) after the end of the Umayyad Caliphate of Cordóba in 1031.
The reason that taifas developed was that there was an administrative division of the Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba and also an ethnic division of the elite of this state. It was divided among Arabs (they werde a powerful but tiny minority), Berbers, Eastern European former slaves and Iberian Muslims (known as "Muladíes" (those were the great majority). 
There was a second period when taifas developed. That was about the middle of the 12th century, when the Almoravid rulers were in decline.
In the 11th century and again in the mid 12th century, the "emirs" (rulers) of thr taifas competed very much among themselves, not only militarily but also for cultural . They tried to recruit the most famous poets and artisans.
After the end of the Caliphate the rival Muslim kingdoms were much weaker than the Christian ones, and had to submit to them and to pay tribute. 
The "taifa" princes appealed for North African warriors to help them fighting Christian kings on two occasions. The Almoravids were invited after the fall of Toledo (1085), and the Almohads after the fall of Lisbon (1147). These warriors did not in fact help the "taifa" emirs but rather annexed their lands to their own North African empires.
Taifas often hired Christian mercenaries to fight neighbouring realms (both Christian and Muslim). The most dynamic taifa, which conquered most of its neighbours before the Almoravid invasion, was Seville. Zaragoza was also very powerful and expansive, but by the neighbour Christian states of the Pyrenees. Zaragoza, Toledo, and Badajoz had previously been the border military districts of the Caliphate.
Additionally, but not usually considered "taifas", are:

The Nasrid dynasty came to power after the defeat of the Almohad dynasty in 1212 at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. Twenty-three different emirs ruled Granada from the founding of the dynasty in 1232 by Muhammed I ibn Nasr until January 2, 1492, when Muhammad XII of Granada surrendered to the Christian Spanish kingdoms of Aragon and Castile. Today, the most visible evidence of the Nasrids is the Alhambra palace built under their rule.

Between 1130 and his death in 1163, Abd al-Mu'min al-Kumi, a Berber from the Masmuda tribe, defeated the ruling Almoravids and became ruler over all northern Africa as far as Libya. He became Emir of Marrakech in 1149 and conquered Al-Andalus, Moorish Iberia. In 1170 the Almohads transferred their capital to Seville. But by 1212 Muhammad III, "al-Nasir" (1199–1214) was defeated by an alliance of the four Christian princes of Castile, Aragón, Kingdom of Navarre and Portugal, at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in the Sierra Morena. The Almohads lost nearly all of the Moorish dominions in Iberia soon after. The great Moorish cities of Córdoba and Seville fell into Christian possession in the first half of the 13th century. The Almohads continued to rule in Africa for some time, but they lost a lot of their territory. The last representative of the line, Idris II, had only Marrakech left.

Base (mathematics)

In mathematics, a base or radix is the number of different digits or combination of digits and letters that a system of counting uses to represent numbers. For example, the most common base used today is the decimal system. Because "dec" means 10, it uses the 10 digits from 0 to 9. Most people think that we most often use base 10 because we have 10 fingers.
A base can be any whole number bigger than 0 (if it was 0, then there would be no digits). The base of a number may be written next to the number: for instance, formula_1means 23 in base 8 (which is equal to 19 in base 10). 
Different bases are often used in computers. Binary (base 2) is used because at the most simple level, computers can only deal with 0s and 1s. Hexadecimal (base 16) is used because of how computers group binary digits together. Every four binary digits turn into one hexadecimal digit when changing between them. Because there are more than 10 digits in hexadecimal, the six digits after 9 are shown as A, B, C, D, E, and F.
The oldest systems of counting used base one. Making marks on a wall, using one mark for each item counted is an example of unary counting. Some old systems of measurement use the duodecimal radix (base twelve). This is shown in English, as there are words such as dozen (12) and gross (144 = 12x12), and lengths such as feet (12 inches).
When typing a base, the small number indicating the base is usually in base 10. This is because if the radix was written in the base it is, it would always be 10, so there would be no way of knowing what base it was. 
Here are some examples of how numbers are written in different bases.

Portuguese man o' war

The Portuguese man o' war ("Physalia physalis") is a Cnidarian invertebrate. It lives in the sea. It is sometimes called the "blue bubble", or "man-of-war". Its common name comes from a Portuguese war ship of the 15th and 16th century. The ship had triangular sails, similar in shape to the bladder of the man o' war.
The Portuguese Man o' War has a reputation for swarming in groups of thousands. It is also known for its powerful sting.
"Physalia" is not a single animal: it is a siphonophore. This is a colony of four kinds of zooids. Zooids are very small, highly modified individuals. These zooids are specialized polyps and medusoids. Though structurally similar to other cnidarians, the zooids do not live by themselves: they are attached to each other. Each type of zooid does not have some structure and functions. It depends for survival on the others doing what it cannot do by itself.
A similar group of animals are the chondrophores. They are specialized hydroids, which also float at the surface of the open ocean.
The loggerhead turtle feeds on the Portuguese man o' war. It is a common part of the turtle's diet. The skin of the turtle is too thick for the man o' war's sting to enter and launch its venom. The sea slug "Glaucus atlanticus" and the violet snail "Janthina janthina" also feed on the Portuguese man o' war. The blanket octopus "Tremoctopus" is immune to the venom of the Portuguese man o' war. The blanket octopus has been known to rip off the man o' war's tentacles and use them for defensive purposes.
The Portuguese man o' war is often found with many different kinds of marine fish. Some of them are shepherd fish, clown fish and yellow jack. These species are rarely found anywhere else. The clown fish can swim among the tentacles without being stung. This is possibly due to its mucus that does not trigger the nematocysts. The shepherd fish seems to avoid the larger, stinging tentacles. It feeds on the smaller tentacles under the gas bladder. These fish benefit from the shelter by the stinging tentacles. It also helps the man o' war: the presence of these species may attract other fish to feed on.

Sleep apnea

Sleep apnea (or Sleep apnoea) is a problem certain people have: When they sleep, they may stop breathing for short periods. These periods can last for 10 seconds or more. 3-4 breaths are "missed". As a result of this, those affected are often tired during the day. Mainly because such people also tend to have microsleep, they should not drive vehicles. Sleep apnea is a treatable disease.
People can ask their partner or family member if they are breathing strangely when they are sleeping.
Diseases which may complicate sleep apnea are: obesity, high blood pressure, hyperlipidaemia, arrhythmia, polyemia, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes etc.
Sleep apnea is a risk factor of arteriosclerotic disease.

Microsleep

Microsleep is a very short sleep that occurs when people are awake. It can last from under a second to about 30 seconds. It may happen as a result of sleep deprivation, fatigue, sleep apnea, narcolepsy, or hypersomnia. Microsleeps can occur at any time. Most of the time, they do so without warning. When people have a microsleep during conversation, they may lose track of the subject that was talked about. 
Microsleep can be extremely dangerous in situations when people drive a car, work on a machine or otherwise need to stay alert. People with microsleeps usually are not aware of them. They instead believe that they were awake all the time. One example is called "gap driving": a person is driving a car and suddenly realizes that several seconds have passed by unnoticed. The driver does not feel that she or he has been asleep during those missing seconds, although this is in fact what happened. The sleeping driver is at very high risk for having an accident during microsleep. 
Many accidents and catastrophes have resulted from microsleep episodes in these circumstances. For example, a microsleep episode is claimed to have been one factor contributing to the Waterfall train disaster in 2003; the driver had a heart attack and the guard who should have reacted to the train's increasing speed is said by his defender to have microslept.

Hello all,

Thats pretty much all from my side. -- () 20:33, 26 March 2009 (UTC)
My two cents: I would much rather have the icons be something that looks professional and would give the readers of the articles the impression that we actually care about or VGAs and GAs. The stars that TOM changed our icons to are not professional (IMHO), and do not give our readers the sense of professionalism that we should be showing to our readers. Heck, that might even get those readers to join our site! I understand that TOM went through a lot of work into making the icons, however, I do not think that those icons are the way to go. I believe that the icons that I changed them to were much better and as Djsasso brought up above, the symbols need to be different for our color blind editors to be able to differentiate between GAs and VGAs. I believe that I accomplished that. The image is pretty universal and I believe that that means that it resembles other Wikipedias' versions of this. The gold VGA star that I added is used on one of the Slavic language Wikipedias. Thanks for hearing me out, 21:45, 26 March 2009 (UTC)

In our table, we seem to always have at least two wrestling articles. This is out of five articles most requested missing from this Wikipedia. Is this useful? Is it genuine? Do we "really" need 40% of our most requested pages to be related to Wrestlemania? Can we have some perspective applied to this, and request pages that are relevant, useful and that would actually improve the reputation of this Wikipedia? Just an idea. () 21:27, 1 April 2009 (UTC)

Hi, could I invite some more of the community to take part in the discussion for the proposal? There seems to be a fair bit of support for the idea but we really need more of the community to discuss the proposal. Discussion is taking place at and the entire proposal can be reviewed . Thanks! 19:51, 19 March 2009 (UTC)
<- I see the two basic opposition positions as 1) legal and 2) not enough editors. I don't think that legal issues will be a major problem here. No one is going to be sued because they uploaded a non-free image that didn't meet the criteria; the worst that will happen is that the lawyers for the copyright holder will make a request that the image is removed. We would then, of course, remove the offending image. Regarding not enough editors; the upload flag would not be given to everyone, you'd have to show that you can use it wisely and I think that there is enough editors now to support the limited amount of images that'd be uploaded on a day-to-day basis. enWP has issues with non-free content because it has so many people who are able to upload, restricting the number of editors doing uploads would fix this. I only ask that editors ignore their prior reasons and deal with this proposal as if it were a new idea. Think on it and then tell us where you are opinionwise. Thanks !! 21:00, 19 March 2009 (UTC)

Back to basics for a moment. "The free encyclopedia that anyone can edit" If non-free images are allowed, this project will not meet the whole purpose of the project () 22:28, 20 March 2009 (UTC)
I've asked Mike Godwin, Esq (the WMF legal counsel) to chime in on the discussion from a legality viewpoint. Thanks! :) 05:59, 21 March 2009 (UTC)
The following is an email I received from Mike Godwin, JD the WMF legal counsel. He indicates that the project, the uploader and the WMF have negligible legal worries in allowing fair-use image uploading.
Basically, the Wikimedia Foundation has significant protection under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The general procedure is that a copyright holder will contact us with a complaint if an image is claimed to be infringing, and we'll remove it. We normally won't raise the defense of fair use -- we get complete immunity if we simply remove the image.
This leaves the uploader -- few uploaders are going to be worth suing, especially if there has been a removal of the image under the DMCA takedown provisions, which immunizes WMF and reduces or eliminates damage to the copyright holder. Since the community is typically pro-active in removing copyrighted material in response to a complaint, we usually don't even see the formalities of a DMCA takedown notice. 
Overall, it is ordinarily the case that if there is a credible fair-use justification for use of material in any project, the risk of liability for WMF is very low, and the risk for an uploader isn't much higher.
--Mike
I personally think this closes down the legal objection to fair-use images. 21:34, 21 March 2009 (UTC)
I don't know if I've been around long enough on simple.wp to be trusted with the "uploader ability", but I've helped out a bunch at and am quite well versed with non-free content guidelines on en (presumably ours would be similar) and the requirements to comply with them. I'll be glad to offer advice to our uploaders on the proper way to tag images. As far as I see it, unless we actually block users from uploading, the best way to do this is to change the current QD definition (I1) to exclude non-free images uploaded by authorized users. Otherwise, all other image uploads would still be immediately deleted by the first available admin. There is technically no need for a special tag, as these users would not be doing anything they can't actually do now. We'd still have to agree on a way of selecting who should be allowed to upload non-free images and not have them immediately deleted. 00:27, 23 March 2009 (UTC)
I would note that legal issues were only one of many reasons put out for why it won't work. Its not even the biggest issue. I still think the project will be irreperably harmed if we switch to allowing images. People keep arguing why should such and such limit our ability to make the wiki better, but I still don't see it as a given that images would make the wiki better. We could limit it to trusted users as mentioned above, but what would constitute a trusted user...and the other option as mentioned with speedying if its not by someone allowed...well that just increases the workload of admins which was the whole point of not allowing images in the first place. - () 22:54, 23 March 2009 (UTC)

Well, I think that all the arguments have now been stated and it's time to hold a poll and see if we can establish a consensus or not. This is a poll, not a !vote. It's merely to see if there is a growing consensus or not. No action will be taken on the results. It's a sort of plebiscite and not a referendum. Right now, where consensus lies is hard to determine. More discussion will take place after this poll. People can close it early if they disagree with it. 
Do we really need a !vote for this? It's completely unecessary... consensus should be looked at through discussion, not !voting... 16:03, 26 March 2009 (UTC)
I think that unless objections are raised by others, we can close this proposal at this time. Reasons for and against have been given and the debate seems to lean towards not going forward at this time. Personally, my reasons for allowing fair-use have all been given in the proposal and I am personally unable to offer more valid reasoning than what I have already offered. I think that we can call the debate a success however as legal concerns were raised and were addresses by way of official WMF opinion and this will make success more likely in any future proposal assuming other objections can be addressed. I think another admin (one who did not take part perhaps) should consider whether or not the debate is exhausted at this time and if so to archive wrap the discussion. Thank you to all for taking part. 12:37, 3 April 2009 (UTC)
It's clear from the discussion above that there is still no clear consensus for this proposal. It's been a useful discussion, but something that we are apparently still not ready for here on Simple English Wikipedia. () 13:00, 3 April 2009 (UTC)

Request: we have a bunch of articles sitting at and a couple at . It's been mighty quiet over there in the past few days, so please, please, let's get the Wikipedia up and rocking. Go read a PGA/PVGA, make suggestions, give comments—get involved!. () 18:28, 3 April 2009 (UTC)
Hello all. Yesterday deleted around half a dozen articles I created under the G12 criterion, i.e. as copyright violation. Each article was a stub and each was created to satisfy a higher purpose, namely that a PVGA (in this case Ipswich Town F.C.) should not have a single red link. While each article was similarly worded to its en wiki counterpart, each article was also stripped to a minimum, perhaps two sentences, which contained the most important facts such as name, birth date and place, and profession (these stubs were biographies by the way). Within the English speaking Wikipedias, there is a generally accepted style for such biographical articles, and as such there will be the inevitable looky-likey issue. 
So, that's the background. I restored the articles and reworked them further, making them less useful, to ensure they didn't fall foul of this implementation of G12. But when I started thinking about it and looking around I found dozens of well-established articles, all of which are clearly "based on en wiki" but offer no attribution (which I believe is the crux of the issue to satisfy GFDL). My test case at the moment is Ronald Reagan whose opening sentence is pretty much identical on this Wikipedia and en wiki. No template exists on the talk page stating a dependency on the en wiki article. Another case, Eastern Grey Kangaroo, created yesterday by an admin, . This article once again is clearly based on en wiki, and in fact Peter has said as much when he created the article, with an edit summary of "Started page from enwiki". Is this sufficient attribution?
Late yesterday, changed (to which I was directed by Synergy), adding a section of exceptions to the policy. This change exempts "very short texts" (which could very well be used to describe the articles I created which were deleted under G12). Are we sure this is the correct thing to tell people?
With admins speedily deleting other admin's stubs, we've once more found ourselves in drama. I don't want to make the situation worse, but I also don't want new editors here to have their work summarily deleted if it really isn't the correct approach. After all, the time taken to determine that a Simple article is "based on en wiki" is a little less than the time taken to then add a template stating that's the case, rather than just speedy deletion. If it is determined that it's okay to G12 stubs created like this, we should seek to include a serious warning banner on our "Create this page" telling people about how exactly to attribute such work. I would be interested in the community's comments. () 10:07, 29 March 2009 (UTC)
I often create pages starting with the en-wiki page as a starting point. I will take out all complex words, simplify etc to get it into simple english. This will mean that the page will often look the same, uses the same pictures etc as the original. I always put an attribution in the edit summary, and a note on the talk page. Copyright should not be a problem with this process as the the GDFL rules allow copying between wikis as long as there is attribution (saying where you copied it from). Pages copied in this way should only be deleted if they do not meet our simple english standard.
We need to be able to create simple stubs to remove redlinks while bringing some articles up to standard. I always try to get back to them and add to them, but this process takes time. But if you have copied the stub it should be attributed, even if you have then simplified or changed it. There is a template to use, it's not hard, just an extra step. -- () 11:47, 29 March 2009 (UTC)
Okay, so our (not policy, note) about pages from other Wikipedia says that to adequately attribute pages copied, we need to clearly state ""where and when you got the information from on the other Wikipedia (eg:"started article using information at exact revision of the article used at the other Wikipedia)"". I see a number of instances of pages being created with just a link to the English Wikipedia article, not a version of it. Is the guideline wrong? Can we simply attribute an article without saying what version of that article we used? () 22:06, 29 March 2009 (UTC)
It seems to me that everyone is just making up whatever policy they think is right. We should base our policies on the actual text of the GFDL (). If you're going to write "Short articles are exempt", then cite the law that says that! I'm not a lawyer either, but I think we need to find a long-term solution that will stand up to scrutiny. 22:40, 29 March 2009 (UTC)
Hello all, this is just to clarify the changes I made to . Please note I am not a lawyer either.
Of course this is all very vague, as a real-world example, does Kilogram need to mention , as a base? -Our article is much shorter and not a verbatim copy, yet was probably written with another wikipedia article in mind. It will really be good to get (at least) a guideline which clarifies those things. 
When I deleted the 6 or 7 articles, I apparently forgot that templating the talk page could easily fix it. For that I apologize. I've been developing a zero tolerance attitude for these types of creations, but will wait until this is all hashed out to delete any other pages per copy vio. Mind you, I didn't delete any pages per , but per (which is in fact marked as policy), or more specifically, the "Moving things from other Wikipedias" section. So if we can get back to firmly grounding and drafting a policy that is satisfactory for simple, while compliant with GFDL, I would appreciate it. As I would like to get back to cleaning up our pedia. 19:02, 30 March 2009 (UTC)
According to our current , pages that "should be discussed for seven days before deletion" include "Pages directly copied from other Wikipedias". It is not entirely clear if this encompasses portions of pages copied directly from other Wikipedias. If it does then G12 currently should never apply to transwikied articles. Either way, we need to revisit this in parallel with redefining G12. And we ought to check our policies and guidelines actually agree with one another. () 09:11, 1 April 2009 (UTC)
I'd like to make the following proposal, which I believe would solve the problem of content being copied from the English Wikipedia (including "based on" and complete verbatim copying). That is, we include the following information in (which is linked from every page). 
This blanket statement provides attribution for content taken from any WMF project (each article would have to have the right interwiki link). I believe this satisfies our obligations under the GFDL as indicated at . 17:38, 2 April 2009 (UTC)

Media studies

Media studies is an academic area of study about mass media and its history and effects. It mostly focuses on newspapers, radio, television, and internet. Media studies take some ideas from other areas of study, such as humanities and the social sciences.
Most production and journalism courses use media studies content, but academic institutions such as universities often start separate departments. Media studies students may see themselves as observers of media, not creators or practitioners. These distinctions are different depending on the country where students live.
The development of media studies was sparked by the growth of new media in the post-Second World War period. A typical source was Marshall McLuhan's "Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man". This bood set out to connect changes in media with changes in society. His most famour phrase was "The medium is the message".

Cliff

A cliff is a vertical or very steep natural wall of rock. 
Cliffs are common on coasts, in mountainous areas, escarpments and along rivers. Cliffs are usually formed by rock that is resistant to erosion and weathering. Sedimentary rocks most likely to form cliffs include sandstone, limestone, chalk, and dolomite. Igneous rocks such as granite and basalt also often form cliffs. An escarpment (or scarp) is a type of cliff, formed by the movement of a geologic fault, or a landslide. Cliffs are known for forming major geographical features such as waterfalls.
The tallest cliff in the solar system may be "Verona Rupes", an approximately 20 km (12 mile) high cliff on Miranda, a moon of the planet Uranus. 
The Ordnance Survey distinguishes between cliffs (continuous line along the top edge with projections down the face) and outcrops (continuous lines along lower edge).

Hurricane Mitch

Hurricane Mitch was the most powerful storm of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season. Hurricane Mitch was one of the most powerful storm ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean. Mitch was the second deadliest Atlantic hurricane because it killed 11,000-18,000 in Central America and Mexico, it is second only to the Great Hurricane of 1780. Mitch also caused over $5 billion in damage. Because the damage and deaths were very high, the name "Mitch" was retired and will never be used for a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean again. It was in 1998 and hit Florida, Central America, Nicaragua and the Yucatán Peninsula.
On October 10 a tropical wave moved off of Africa. It stayed as a tropical wave because the conditions in Atlantic wasn't good enough for it to become a tropical depression or tropical storm. The tropical wave became Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 22, because conditions became better. On October 23 Tropical Depression Thirteen strengthened and became Tropical Storm Mitch. Tropical Storm Mitch made a small loop after becoming a tropical storm and then turned north. 
Tropical Storm Mitch strengthened and became Hurricane Mitch on October 24. Hurricane Mitch then turned west. Mitch strengthened very fast and on October 26 Mitch reached its top winds. Its top winds were are 180 mph making it a category 5. Mitch stayed as a category 5 turned south. 
Mitch started weakening on October 27 and by October 29 Mitch was only a category 1. On October 29 Hurricane Mitch made landfall in Honduras, with the winds at 80 mph. Mitch quickly weakened into a tropical storm. Tropical Storm Mitch moved very slowly and almost froze over Honduras. Tropical Storm Mitch weakened into a tropical depression as it entered Guatemala. 
As Tropical Depression Mitch entered Mexico it became a remnant low and was not a tropical depression anymore. The remains entered the Bay of Campeche and became Tropical Storm Mitch again on November 3. Mitch moved northeast and made landfall in the Yucatán Peninsula. Mitch weakened into a tropical depression over the Yucatán Peninsula. Once Tropical Depression Mitch reached the Gulf of Mexico it became Tropical Storm Mitch. Tropical Storm Mitch continued northeast and made landfall in Naples, Florida on November 5 as a tropical storm with the winds at 65 mph. 
After Tropical Storm Mitch crossed Florida it became extratropical and was no longer a tropical storm. The remains were last seen on November 9 north of Great Britain. 
Many countries of the in Central American Region had record amounts of rainfall.
The worst affects from the hurricane were seen in Honduras, where Mitch caused 7,000 deaths and $3.8 billion in damage. In Honduras rainfall could have been up to 75 inches. Crops in Honduras were impacted very badly, Mitch destroyed, 58% of the corn output, 24% of sorghum, 14% of rice, and 6% of the bean crop. Mitch also destroyed 85% of banana, 60% of sugar cane, 29% of melons, 28% of African palms, and 18% of coffee. Just the crop damage from Hurricane Mitch in Honduras was at $900 million. 
Also in Nicaragua rainfall may have been up to 50 inches. The rains stopped a volcano in Nicaragua, instead the volcano caused a mudslide. The mudslide covered an area 10 miles long and 5 miles wide. Hurricane Mitch left between 500,000 and 800,000 people homeless. Damaged in Nicaragua totaled to $1 billion and at least 3,800 were killed in Nicaragua. 
In the U.S. only Florida was affected. In Florida, Mitch destroyed buildings in the Keys that were damaged by Hurricane Georges. Mitch killed 2 people and left $40 million in damage. 
Hurricane Mitch caused rain all the way down to Panama, where the hurricane killed 3 people. Offshore in the Caribbean Sea the hurricane sunk a boat causing 31 people to drowned. In Costa Rica Hurricane Mitch caused about 4,000 people to become homeless. Hurricane Mitch caused mudslides that affected nearly 800 miles of road. Hurricane Mitch left $92 million in damage and killed 7 people. In El Salvador the flooding from Mitch destroyed 37% of the bean production, 19% of the corn production, and 20% losses in sugar canes. Hurricane Mitch also killed 10,000 cattle. In El Salvador the damage from Mitch was at $400 million and 240 people were killed. In Guatemala Hurricane Mitch caused 6,000 houses to be destroyed and damaged 20,000 others. Damage just the banana and coffee exports were at $325 million. Mitch caused a plane to crash leaving 11 people to get killed indirectly, Mitch also caused 268 people to get killed directly. Damages left from Mitch in Guatemala was at $748 million. In Belize Mitch caused some crop damage and damage many roads. Damage in Belize was not as bad as it could have been. Mitch killed 11 in Belize, but no one knows the damage it caused. 
Hurricane Mitch caused waves about 7 feet in Jamaica. Mitch killed about 3 people, but no one knows the damage. Also, a house in Spanish Town was destroyed. 
Because of the deaths and damage the name Mitch was removed and retired. Meaning, the name will not be used again to name a storm in the Atlantic Ocean. In 2004 the name Matthew was used instead. The name Matthew will be used again in 2010 because it was not retired.

Miacis

Miacis is a small extinct carnivore of the family Miacidae. They were small mammals which lived in forests and climbed trees. They had the ancestral mammalian 44 teeth. "Miacis" had brains that were relatively larger than those of the creodonts, and the larger brain size compared to body size suggests their behaviour was more flexible and possibly more intelligent.
Miacids are either early members of the order Carnivora or in a larger group called the Carnivoramorpha. They may not be monophyletic. One professional opinion is that most "Miacis" species belong to the ancestors of the modern order, the crown-group Carnivora.

Bose–Einstein condensate

Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) is what happens to a dilute gas when it is made very cold, near absolute zero. It forms when the particles that make it up have very low energy. Only bosons can make a Bose–Einstein condensate, when they are close to 0 K (or −273° C, or −459.67 °F). The gas has extremely low density, about one-hundred-thousandth the density of normal air.
A Bose–Einstein condensate is a change of state. When matter is in the BEC state it has zero viscosity. Superfluidity and superconductivity are both closely connected with the BEC state of matter.
Particles can only have a set amount of energy. They either have the energy to bounce around in gases or just the energy to flow like a liquid or be fixed like a solid. If you take enough of the particle's energy away you get to the tiniest or the smallest amount of energy possible. This is a Bose–Einstein condensate. This makes all of the particles exactly the same and instead of bouncing around randomly in all different directions, they all bounce up and down in exactly the same way, forming something called a 'giant matter wave'.
The Bose-Einstein Condensate was first suggested by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein in 1924–25. Seventy years later its existence was proved. Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman made the first Bose–Einstein condensate in 1995 at the University of Colorado. Cornell, Wieman, and Wolfgang Ketterle at MIT were then given the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Usually to get anything cold enough to make a Bose–Einstein condensate you have to first trap the stuff using magnets and then, by bouncing lasers off them, take all of their energy away through red shift. This still does not get things quite cold enough. Some of the particles will still be bouncing around a lot and only some will be lying down nicely. The magnetic field is then slowly lowered bit by bit to let the faster bouncing particles out. This just leaves us with the coldest and slowest atoms inside.

Mrs Beeton

Mrs Beeton (born Isabella Mary Mayson, 12 March 1836 – 6 February 1865) was known around the world as Mrs Beeton. She was the English author of "Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management", and is one of the most famous cookbook writers.
Isabella was born at 24 Milk Street, Cheapside, London, England. Her father, Benjamin Mayson, died when she was young and her mother, Elizabeth Jerram later married Henry Dorling, who was a widower and he had four children of his own. They lived in Epsom, Surrey where Henry was Clerk of Epsom Racecourse. Isabella was sent to school in Heidelberg, Germany, where she became a very good pianist. When she finished school, she went back to Epsom.
Isabella's husband, Samuel Orchart Beeton, was also born in Milk Street. Even after the move to Epsom the two mothers of Samuel and Isabella kept talking to one another. On a visit to London, Isabella was introduced to Samuel Beeton who had become a publisher of books and popular magazines. They married on 10 July 1856 at Epsom Parish Church. In August of that year they moved into their first home, a large Italianate property at 2 Chandos Villas on the Woodridings Estate in Hatch End.
Their first child, Samuel Orchart, was born in May 1857 but he died of croup in August of that year. In September 1859, another son was born, and his name was also Samuel Orchart.
During Isabella's time in Hatch End she began to write articles on cooking and how to manage a house for her husband's publications. In 1859–1861, she wrote something every month for "The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine". In October 1861, the writings were published as a single book, "The Book of Household Management".
The Beetons left Hatch End in the autumn of 1861. In December of that year their son became sick with scarlet fever while on holiday in Brighton. He died on New Year's Eve. Mrs. Beeton gave birth to two other sons, Orchart (on New Year's Eve in 1863) and Mayson Moss (in January 1865).
The book was very well known as "Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management", it was a guide to running a Victorian household, with advice on fashion, child care, animal husbandry, poisons, the management of servants, science, religion, and . 
The book had 1,112 pages, and over 900 of the pages were recipes. Because many of the pages were recipes, it became known as "Mrs Beeton's Cookbook". Most of the recipes were illustrated with colored pictures, and it was the first book to show recipes in a way that is still used today. It is said that many of the recipes were actually taken from earlier writers (including Eliza Acton), but the Beetons never claimed that the book's contents were original. It was supposed to be a guide of reliable information for the middle class people. Mrs Beeton is described better as the books and editor than as its author, because many of the passages were not in her own words.
The day after the birth of her fourth child, in January 1865, Isabella became sick with puerperal fever. She died a week later at the age of 28. Her widower lived for another twelve years. He died of tuberculosis in June 1877 at the age of 46.
The couple are buried in West Norwood Cemetery in Lambeth under a simple headstone.

South Region of Brazil

The South Region of Brazil is one of the five administrative regions of Brazil. It includes the states of Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul and covers 576,300.8 km², being the smallest portion of the country. It is a great tourist, economic and cultural pole. It borders Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay as well as the Center-West Region, the Southeast Region and the Atlantic Ocean. The region received many immigrants of Europe during the 19th century, who largely influenced the demography and cultural aspects of it. The main ethnic groups of Southern Brazil are Brazilians of Portuguese, German and Italian descent.
The capital of Paraná state, Curitiba, has the largest population and also the largest economy, and the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, has the largest metropolitan area.
It is the only region of Brazil located outside the tropical zone, with clear variations about the seasons. In winter there are frosts and rarely snow. The relief is just a bit hilly, with a predominance of a large plateau, in general low.
What most characterizes the South is the way it was colonized and kind of colonizers received. Received short black slaves, but many Caucasian immigrants. The Europeans gave the population the predominance of white skin color, gave to the landscape marks of their original countries and introduced the system of medium and small farms.
The southern region has good social indicators : it has the highest HDI in Brazil (0.831), and the third highest GDP per capita of the country. The region is also, 94.8% of the population.
The region is highly urbanized (82%) and many cities are famous for their urban planning, like Curitiba and Maringá. It has a relatively high standard of living in many aspects, with the highest Human Development Index of Brazil, 0.859 (2007), and the second highest per capita income of the country, $13.396. The region is also the most literate, 94% literacy rate.
Some places in the region must be emphasized, such as the Iguaçu Falls, (Natural Heritage and one of the New7Wonders of Nature) and the Ruins of St. Michael of the Missions (Cultural Heritage); the Itaipu Dam (the largest dam of the world, elected the as one of the seven modern Wonders of the World); the winter cities on mountains of the SC and RS; and the Botanical Garden of Curitiba, Southern Brazil greatest icon.
The first inhabitants of southern Brazil are the indigenous people. Then came the Spanish Jesuit priests to evangelize the Indians and dominate the land. The pioneers of São Paulo attacked the missions to arrest the Indians. So, the Jesuits and the Indians abandoned the place and the cattle got loose in the fields. The São Paulo pioneers became interested in the trade of cattle. On the way through which the troops passed villages have emerged. For many years, the Portuguese and Spaniards fought over land in the region.
The population of the South has grown with the arrival of the first European immigrants in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: Germans, Italians, Poles, Ukrainians immigrated to the region, which also received Japanese, Arabs and Jews.
The capital of Paraná state, Curitiba, has the largest population and also the largest economy, and the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, has the largest metropolitan area.
The region received large numbers of European immigrants during the 19th century, who have had a large influence on its demography and culture. The main ethnic origins of Southern Brazil are Portuguese, Italian, and German.
Portuguese, the official language of Brazil, is spoken by the entire population. But in some places dialects of German or Italian origins are also spoken; some villages even use the language of immigrants. In Porto Alegre and Curitiba there are some Yiddish speakers.
The hydrography of Southern Brazil can be classified in three great regions of Watersheds: the Paraná River, the Uruguay River and the Southeast Brazil Rivers.
The rivers of the southern region are availed for navigation, irrigation agriculture, urban water supply and power generation. The most important rivers are voluminous and have great hydroelectric potential. The Itaipu Dam, on the Parana River, is exploring the potential for power generation in the region. This operation allows the South and the Southeast an increasing use of electricity for domestic and industrial use.
Only Brazilian region located almost entirely in a subtropical climate, the South is the coldest area of Brazil, with frost and even, in some places, the snowfall. The seasons are well defined and the rains are evenly distributed over the year.
Southern Brazil has subtropical or temperate climate. The annual average temperatures vary between 12 °C (53.6 °F) and 22 °C (71.6 °F). Frost is very common and can snow in some mountain ranges.
The relief of the region is characterized by many plateaus that rises at altitudes up to more than 1,000 meters above sea level, decreasing altitude in the west, where the Paraná River at altitudes from 100 to 300 meters. Covering about 3/4 parts of the regional relief, this set is called "Southern Plateau of Brazil" and breaks down into plateaus that go from east to west.
The region has as main tourist attractions their natural beauty, beaches, historical cities and their European colonies, and the well-defined seasons, characterized by the severe winter.
In Paraná, the Iguassu Falls receive thousands of tourists every year, being the main destination for foreigners in the region. The state also has a geological site of approximately 340 million years, with huge rock formations. The capital, Curitiba, was considered the best southern city for tourism
In Santa Catarina the beaches receive many visitors, and the winter colonies in the state.
The Rio Grande do Sul state - like Santa Catarina - attracts tourists in winter to the cities in mountain, where the cold is intense.

Edmund Stoiber

Edmund Rüdiger Stoiber, German pronunciation: ˈɛtmʊnt ˈʃtɔʏbɐ, (born 28 September 1941) is a German politician. He used to be the Minister-President of the state of Bavaria and the leader of the Christian Social Union party (CSU). On 18 January 2007, he said he no longer wanted to be minister-president and party leader by 30 September, after having been by his own party for weeks.
Edmund Stoiber was born in Oberaudorf in the district of Rosenheim, Bavaria. Before he became a member of the Bavarian parliament in 1974, he was a lawyer and worked at the University of Regensburg. 
Stoiber is married to Karin Stoiber. They have three children: Konstanze (1971), Veronika (1977), Dominik (1980) and three grandchildren: Johannes (1999), Benedikt (2001) and Theresa Marie (2005).
Stoiber was a student at Ignaz-Günther-Gymnasium in Rosenheim, where he received his Abitur (high school diploma) in 1961. He served the military with the mountain infantry division but had to leave because he hurt his knee. After his military service, Stoiber studied political science and later law in Munich. In 1967 he passed the state law exam and then worked at the University of Regensburg in criminal law and Eastern European law. He became a doctor of jurisprudence, and then in 1971 passed the second state examination.
In 1978 Stoiber was elected secretary general of the CSU, which he stayed until 1982/83. From 1982 to 1986 he was a representative to the Bavarian secretary of the state and then a minister of state from 1982 to 1988. From 1988 to 1993 he was the Bavarian Minister of the Interior and in May 1993, the Bavarian "Landtag" (parliament) elected him as minister-president. As such he served as President of the "Bundesrat" in 1995/96. In 1998, he was made leader of the CSU.
In 2002, Stoiber removed the leader of the CDU, Angela Merkel, and was made the joint CDU/CSU's candidate for the office of chancellor, with Gerhard Schröder (SPD) as opponent.
Before the 2002 election, the CSU/CDU was on top of the opinion polls and Stoiber said that "...this election is like a football match where it's the second half and my team is ahead by 2-0", a quote that has become famous. However, on election day things had changed. The SPD had a huge comeback and the CDU/CSU got less votes. Both the SPD and CDU/CSU had 38.5% of the vote, but the SPD was ahead by 6,000 votes. Gerhard Schröder was elected again as chancellor by the parliament. He joined together with the Green party. Many people think it was Stoiber's reaction to the floods in eastern Germany, shortly before the election, that made his party lose the vote. Also, Schröder made clear that he was against the Iraq war led by the United States. He made the war the main topic in his campaign, which was seen by many people as the changing factor in the weeks before the election.
Stoiber is a great football fan and he supports the FC Bayern Munich. Before the 2002 election FC Bayern's manager Uli Hoeneß said he supported Stoiber and the CSU. Football legend, FC Bayern President and Vice-President of the German Football Association, Franz Beckenbauer, on the other hand, showed his support for Stoiber by letting him join the German national football team on their flight home from Japan after the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

When Damocles was found, in 1991 by Robert H. McNaught, it was found to be on an orbit that was very different from all others known. Damocles' orbit reached from inside the aphelion (farthest approach from the Sun) of Mars to as far as Uranus. Its orbit seemed to be changing from an almost round outer solar system orbit to a stretched orbit taking it to the inner solar system. Duncan Steel, Gerhard Hahn, Mark Bailey, and David Asher found out what's it's future could be, and found a good chance that it will become an Earth-crosser asteroid, and may spend a quarter of its life in such an orbit. Damocles has a stable orbit for tens of thousands of years before and after the present, because its highly tilted orbit does not take it near Jupiter or Saturn.

Los Angeles River

The Los Angeles River (also called: El Rio De Nuestra Senora La Reina De Los Angeles De Porciuncula or Porciuncula River; Spanish: "River of the Angels"; informally LA River) is a river flowing through Los Angeles County, California, in the United States. About long, it flows from a place called Canoga Park south and west to its end at the Long Beach Harbor, in San Pedro Bay, part of the Pacific Ocean. The basin is rimmed by the San Gabriel Mountains, Santa Monica Mountains and Santa Susana Mountains, as well as several smaller mountain ranges. Much of the water that flows in the Los Angeles River flows in from tributaries that come from the mountains.
The river was once free-flowing, winding across a floodplain that occupied much of the Los Angeles Basin. With its frequent floods, it often changed course, causing erosion and depositing silt in other places. When the city of Los Angeles had its first settlers around the 1850s, the river was its main water source. With the opening of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, the Los Angeles River was no longer needed as a water source. Today, the Los Angeles River runs in a fixed course through a concrete channel for nearly its whole length. It is heavily polluted. The primary source of water during summer and fall is the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant in Van Nuys. Plans for restoration of the river are being discussed.
The watershed of the Los Angeles River covers 834 square miles (2,135 square kilometers). The Santa Monica Mountains and smaller Simi Hills border it on the east side. On the west side lies the San Gabriel Mountains and Santa Susana Mountains. Seven major tributaries flow into the Los Angeles River: Burbank Western Channel, Aliso Wash, Tujunga Wash, Verdugo Wash, Arroyo Seco, Compton Creek, and Rio Hondo. 360 square miles (920 square kilometers) of the watershed are open space, while the remaining 474 square miles (1,215 square kilometers) are highly developed with all kinds of land uses.
The river officially begins in a place called Canoga Park, in the San Fernando Valley. Bell Creek and Calabasas Wash (Arroyo Calabasas or Calabasas Creek; "Calabasa" is Spanish for "pumpkin") flow from opposite sides of the valley to a point () where the Los Angeles River officially begins. At this point, the river already flows in a concrete channel. In times of flood, the channel can move between per hour to up to 
Tujunga Wash, Aliso Wash, and Brown's Canyon Wash join the river from the left. The river flows on to a basin called the "Sepulveda basin", controlled by a dam at its southeastern end. This basin is incredibly rich in wildlife and plants. Normally, there wouldn not be a year-round flow of water here. But because of 75 million gallons of water flowing into the river every day from the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant, there is an year-round flow of water. This water is not suitable to be drinking water, but is safe to touch.
An important tributary, Verdugo Wash, flows in from the left. The Verdugo Wash begins in the Verdugo Hills and flows west to the Los Angeles River. Uniquely, the intersection of Interstate 5 and Route 134 is located right above this point. The Los Angeles River makes a great bend west around Griffith Park, a big park in the middle of Los Angeles. Here, the river has an earthen bottom, which is unique because most of the river is covered with concrete. Further downstream, there is a place uniquely named "Frogtown" because of the many frogs once found in the river there. Downstream from this place, the river picks up another important tributary, Arroyo Seco, on the left. (The name "Arroyo Seco" means "dry creek" in Spanish.) The Arroyo Seco begins in the San Gabriel Mountains and flows south to the Los Angeles River. One important feature of the Arroyo Seco is the giant Devil's Gate Dam. The Arroyo Seco is free-flowing in many places. 
After flowing a few more miles, the Los Angeles River becomes very wide. The final large tributary, Rio Hondo (Spanish for "deep river") flows in from the left, in the city of South Gate. Notably, the sediment here is over deep. Here, the threat of floods is always present. In fact, in a flood in 1992, the water was only a few inches below the top of the riverbank. As the river approaches San Pedro Bay and eventually the Pacific Ocean, it passes by the RMS Queen Mary, a retired ocean liner now a museum and hotel.
The Los Angeles River was originally a free-flowing river, running across a wide basin that would periodically flood. The river would have heavy flows in the winter and spring (rainy season) and little to no flow in the summer and fall (dry season). However, water being forced out of an aquifer below the Los Angeles Basin gave parts of the river an year-round flow. This phenomenon can still be seen today, most notably in a place called Griffith Park where water rises out of the ground and feeds the river.
The river was used for hundreds of years by Native Americans as a source of drinking water and food. When Spanish explorers came to the area in the 1760s, they named the river the Porciuncula, seeing that it was a good site for a settlement. The full name they gave the river was actually "El Río de Nuestra Señora La Reina de Los Ángeles de Porciúncula", which translated to English means: The River of Our Lady Queen of the Angels of Porciúncula. (Porciuncula is a small church in Italy.) But they were to soon find out, the Los Angeles River had, and still has, a long history of floods. Many times when the river flooded, it would change course from Ballona Creek, a stream flowing into Santa Monica Bay on the northeast; to its original channel flowing into San Pedro Bay. One big flood in 1825, it left Ballona Creek and flowed into its old channel, and Ballona Creek became a separate, long waterway. It still is that way today.
The city of Los Angeles rose beside the Los Angeles River, inland at the site of the old Spanish settlement. In 1889, San Pedro Bay, the place where the river flows into, was chosen as the city harbor. A series of railroads were needed to connect the city with the port. The most logical route was beside the river, since that was the smoothest land. With the railroads came industry, which rose up all along the lower Los Angeles River. With its disastrous flood history, and the fact that it was too shallow for boats, the river was finally forced into a concrete channel beginning in 1938. 
1938 was the same year that a terrible flood struck the region. From February 27 to March 1, 1938, a storm approached the California coast. Over 4.4 inches (11cm) of rain fell. That was the equivalent of one-fourth the average yearly rainfall in the area. Finally, on 5:45 AM on March 4, the rain ended, and the flood slowly dropped in level. it seemed similar to the earlier flood in 1934. Everyone thought that it was already over, but it was not. 15 hours later, another storm hit Southern California, dumping another 6-10 inches (15-25 cm) of rain. The soils of the region could not take in any more water from the rains of the past few days. The three major rivers in the region, the Los Angeles, San Gabriel, and the Santa Ana, burst their levees and flooded three California counties.
It was the 5th largest flood in the recorded history of the area. 5,601 houses were destroyed, 1,500 houses were damaged, and 800 cars were trapped in the mud. But Los Angeles County was not as affected as neighboring Riverside County and Orange County, for it was those two counties that suffered the worst floods.
However, the flood was not as bad as it could have been. Fourteen flood control dams in the mountains and around the Los Angeles area held back huge amounts of water, which would otherwise add to the flood. These dams included the Hansen Dam, Big Tujunga Dam, and San Gabriel No. 1 and No. 2. At its peak, the Los Angeles River's flow was about 38,000 cubic feet (1,076 cubic meters) per second. The nearby San Gabriel River's flow, though, approached 100,000 cubic feet (2,832 cubic meters) per second. Most flooded of all was the "crazy-mad" Santa Ana River, which looked like a "slightly smaller version of the Mississippi."
Many restoration efforts to convert the river from a concrete-lined channel back to its natural state have been proposed recently. Also, some river conservation groups, most notably Friends of the Los Angeles River (FoLAR) have been created. 
The Los Angeles River Master Plan was created in 1991 as a plan to restore a large stretch of the river and one of its large tributaries, the Tujunga Wash. Part of the incentive for the project is because the "Great Wall of Los Angeles", one of the largest murals in the world, is painted on the wall of the Tujunga Wash. Other than that, the plan seeks to improve recreation, health, property value, environment, and education in the communities surrounding the river; by building a series of parks. This helps to increase the open space available in Los Angeles; its open space percentage is uncharacteristically low. For example, the city of Boston has 9% open space, over twice as much as Los Angeles' 4% open space.
Notably, the City of Los Angeles agreed in 2007, by a 12-0 vote, to spend some $2 billion USD over the next 50 years. The money will be used to fund over 200 separate projects, including parks, walkways, and pedestrian bridges; along a stretch of the river. Some factories and other buildings near the river will be removed so houses can be built closer to the river.
The biggest city beside the Los Angeles River is Los Angeles. There are many other cities and towns that lie beside the river.

Its watershed is about 30.4 square miles (79 square kilometers) in size. The name comes from the Spanish word "aliso", meaning alder. Six tributaries join it along its length, which are Wood Canyon Creek, Sulphur Creek, the Dairy Fork, Aliso Hills Channel, Munger Creek and English Canyon.
The creek is heavily polluted. Urban runoff from streets in cities around the creek flow into it, contributing to an increased year-round flow and excessive pollution. To this day, the creek is still a big problem in terms of pollution at its mouth, the popular Aliso Creek Beach.

Chord progression

A chord progression is a part of music, made up of several chords played one after another. Chord progressions are important for people who write songs or play musical instruments that can play chords, such as the guitar. Chord progressions are used in many types of music. How a piece of music sounds has to do with its chord progression.
The circle of fifths is an idea in music theory that has to do with keys. It also has to do with chord progressions. If you have a song with the chord progression G, C, D, you can see those chords are right next to each other in the circle. So if you want to play the same song in a different key, you can use any other three chords right next to each other. This works for any chord progression.
One of the most used chord progressions is based on the first, fourth and fifth notes of a major scale. In the key of C, these are the C, F, and G chords. This progression is used in many simple songs. Since these songs have only three chords, they are sometimes called three-chord songs. Many country, blues, rock, pop and punk songs are three-chord songs.

Interstate 81 is a north-south interstate in the eastern United States. It runs from Dandridge, Tennessee in the south to Wellesley Island, New York in the north; for a total distance for about . It follows the Appalachian Mountains for nearly its entire length.
Interstate 81 begins in Tennessee at Interstate 40 in Dandridge. The route follows the Appalachian Mountains for much of its route through Tennessee and Virginia, serving such cities as the twin cities of Bristol, Tennessee and Bristol, Virginia, Roanoke, Blacksburg, Lexington, Staunton, Harrisonburg, and Winchester. In Harrisonburg, I-81 cuts through the James Madison University campus. It follows its older counterpart, U.S. Route 11, for its entire length in Virginia.
Interstate 81 briefly enters the eastern panhandle of West Virginia, serving the city of Martinsburg. It then crosses the state of Maryland at one of its narrowest points, passing through the "Hub City" of Hagerstown where it intersects with a large number of other routes.
Interstate 81 forms a major north–south corridor through the state of Pennsylvania, serving the boroughs of Chambersburg and Carlisle, where it meets the Pennsylvania Turnpike. But I-81 does not directly interchange with it (motorists must use US 11 to connect). Around the state capital of Harrisburg, the route forms the northeastern section of Pennsylvania's Capital Beltway. The route then travels northeast toward the Wyoming Valley, where it serves the cities of Wilkes-Barre and Scranton, then heads north through the Endless Mountains region toward the state line. Although it is signed as a north–south highway, it is distinctly northeast–southwest and occasionally east–west throughout the state.
Interstate 81 enters the state of New York near Binghamton. It follows U.S. Route 11 in a north–south direction, through much of the state. It serves the cities of Syracuse (where it intersects the New York State Thruway), and Watertown. The route ends at the Canadian border at the Thousand Islands Bridge, where it crosses the St. Lawrence River, continuing as a short connector, Highway 137, which serves the Thousand Islands Parkway and Highway 401.
The Interstate 81 Corridor Coalition, a six-state coalition, was organized to handle issues along Interstate 81, such as truck traffic and air pollution. As of October 15, 2008, this commission has met twice.

North-east India

North-East India refers to the easternmost region of the Republic of India. Geographically and culturally, the region now called north-east India is situated between the two traditions of Indic Asia and Mongoloid Asia and is regarded as part of Southeast Asia. This geographical-cultural condition of "in-betweenness" is an important factor in the area’s crisis of identity. The leaders of the present-day "underground outfits" continue to struggle for independence, as the political integration of the northeast to India was brought about without the approval of its people. The people of northeast India, who are culturally Mongoloid, refuse to accept the caste-ridden social system advocated by ‘Indian’ culture. Similar struggles for independence are also going on in other northeastern subdivisions or sister regions, such as Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Nagaland.

Conficker

Conficker (also known as Downup, Downadup and Kido) is a computer worm that first showed up in October 2008. It targeted the Microsoft Windows operating system. It is not known where the name "conficker" came from. "Internet experts" have guessed that the name comes from a mix between two different words: "configure" and "ficken", the German word for "fuck".
Conficker was believed to be the worst computer worm since the SQL slammer worm in 2003. It was estimated 15 million computers were infected with Conficker. The virus was supposed to get worse on April 1, 2009, which caused many people to worry about it. However, there were no bad effects.
On 13 February 2009, Microsoft offered a $250,000 USD reward for help with finding and arresting the people who created the computer worm.

<doc id="176362" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176362" title="Positivism">
Positivism

Positivism is the belief that human knowledge is produced by the scientific interpretation of observational data.
The approach has been an ongoing "theme in the history of western thought from the Ancient Greeks to the present day". The thought was created in the early 19th century by the philosopher and founding sociologist, Auguste Comte.
Comte, a sociologist, believed in a three part model of human knowledge. He claimed that it had gone through the phases of a religious and metaphysical worldview before the scientific interpretation was considered. The positivistic method should, said Comte, no longer aim at a revelation of ultimate causes. It should rather focus on how data are linked together. Scientists would simply interpret these correlations. All human knowledge could only be relatively true, so Comte with a look at these interpretations. Late 19th-century philosophers of the sciences from Heinrich Hertz to Ernst Mach eventually discussed specific requirements of operable scientific theories and physical laws such as the predictability of results in experiments and the functionality of laws in computations.
In its strongest original formulation, positivism could be thought of as a set of five principles:
Unlike materialists positivists do not make any claims about a primary substance such as matter. They assume that we have data and that we interpret the data. The idea of a material world with three dimensions is, for positivists, just a good model to handle the experiences of everyday life. If astronomy has to deal with more complex data that cannot be handled consistently in such a model, they will have to think of a different model. Early 20th-century positivists like Ernst Mach said that the best model is the most "economical" model, that is the model we can use best in calculations and predictions.
The idea that all physical laws could be useful dates back to Auguste Comte. Comte said that all theories were merely "relatively" true, and that even Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation was strictly speaking nothing but a social convention true until new data force us to find a better theory.
This was an important development in early 20th century Vienna, led by Moritz Schlick and widened by Ludwig Wittgenstein.
It held not only that propositions were true or false, but that statements which could not be verified (shown to be either true or false) were meaningless. Thus statements like "There is a God" or "There is no God" are not true or false, but meaningless.
The whole idea was explained in English by a famous little book by A.J. Ayer, "Language, truth and logic" in 1936.
This was the idea of P.W. Bridgman, Nobel Prize in Physics for 1946. It was that a concept in science was defined by the way one measured it. If one thinks of electron spin, or the curvature of space, these are not everyday ideas. In everyday life, electrons are not seen, and neither is space seen to be curved. They rest on the results of experiments which measured fundamental properties like time, light, mass, electrical charge, and so on. What Bridgman meant is that their meaning is in the way the measurements were done.
19th-century positivism – or "Comtean positivism" – included the outline of a proposed development. This would lead from primitive explanations, through religious thought and monotheism, to positivism as the universal theory and scientific practice. The theory was very influential among cultural historians. It led Comte to the creation a "religion of humanity" as a secular substitute for all religions. This caused an outcry among scientists, who were ready to adopt the scientific premises but not interested in creating a substitute religion.
One can today still visit temples in Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, and Curitiba in Brazil, and Paris built by 19th-century Comtean positivists. London had a society of positivists. The Turkish leader Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was strongly interested in positivism as the basis of a secularisation of the nation, he was trying to build.
The term positivism is today no longer connected to the construct of a secular religion, but more to describe a scientific method.

Norton Internet Security

Norton Internet Security is a security program made by Symantec Corporation that protects computers from malware. It includes antivirus, firewall, e-mail filter, and phishing protection software. It also includes features like parental controls which can be downloaded as a add-on. 
You can get it from a download, a box copy in a store, or from a company that is an OEM. Norton Internet Security and its sister product, Norton AntiVirus, combined, held a 61% antivirus market share as of 2007. Major competitors in terms of market share include antivirus products from vendors CA, Trend Micro, and Kaspersky Lab. 
Norton Internet Security runs on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. Version 16.5.0.135 is the latest update available for Norton Internet Security 2009, made available for users encountering issues when updating to build 16.5.0.134. The latest Mac version is 4.0. 
In August of 1990 Symantec acquired Peter Norton Computing from Peter Norton. Norton and his company developed various utilities, or applications for DOS. Symantec continued the development of acquired technologies. The technologies are marketed under the name of "Norton", with the tagline "from Symantec". Norton's crossed-arm pose, a registered U.S. trademark, was featured on Norton product packaging. However, his pose was later moved to the spine of the packaging, and later dropped altogether.
Product activation was introduced to Norton Internet Security 2004, addressing the estimated 3.6 million counterfeit Norton products sold. A alphanumeric code is generated to identify a computer's configuration, which ties in with the product key. Users are allowed to activate their product five times with the same product key. Spyware detection and removal was introduced to the 2005 version for Windows, with the tagline "Antispyware Edition". The tagline was dropped in later releases. 
Existing users of the 2006, 2007, or 2008 versions can upgrade to the latest 2009 version without buying a new subscription. Upgrading will preserve the number of days left on a user's subscription.
Norton Internet Security 2006 debuted on September 26, 2005. The main graphical user interface, dubbed the Norton Protection Center aggregates all information in a central location. CNET reports the Norton Protection Center, while useful, attempts to advertise additional products and services from Symantec. 
To help identify zero-day malware, Bloodhound technology disassembles and scans application code for possibly malicious instructions. Norton can revert Internet Explorer homepage hijacking attempts and block advertisements. Users are warned of unauthorized changes to Internet Explorer's homepage, and given an option to revert such changes. Advertisement blocking rewrites a website's HTML to prevent advertisements from being displayed. E-mail filtering scans POP3 mail for spam. It can be configured using either a blacklist or a whitelist. Users can also correct Norton's classification of e-mail on a individual basis. Parental controls, bundled with this release, allow users to block specific sites, block certain programs from accessing the Internet, and restrict newsgroup access. Norton can block the transmission of confidential information. Users can enter information which are not to be communicated via instant messenger, e-mail, or webforms. 
CNET noted this version's noticeable toll on system performance, especially when opening files across a network or on a removable disk. Oli Warner also noted Norton's significant drag when opening or creating files, compared to similar offerings from different vendors. PC Magazine noted the program's lengthy installation time and weak spam filtering feature; valid e-mail messages were marked as spam and actual spam e-mail were not. 
Windows 98 compatibility was dropped from this release. System requirements were Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 or Windows XP, 325 Megabytes of free hard drive space, a 300 MHz processor, and 256 MB of RAM.
The 2007 version was released on September 12, 2006. 80 percent of the code was rewritten, with the goal of reducing high system resource utilization. A tabbed interface allows users to access the Norton Protection Center and the program settings without separate windows open. Symantec also extended its Veritas VxMS technology, enhancing rootkit detection. VxMS allows Norton to detect inconsistencies among files within directories and files at the volume level. Phishing detection was introduced in this release for Internet Explorer. Norton checks sites visited in Internet Explorer against a blacklist and analyzes sites' code. Other features include a exploit scanner which looks at system components commonly hosting vulnerabilities, such as Internet Explorer settings. Supplementing the scanner, real-time exploit protection blocks attackers from leveraging common browser and application vulnerabilities. When possible, Norton will fix issues found; otherwise the user is warned of the vulnerability. A startup application manager allows users to prevent applications from launching at login. 
E-mail spam filtering, parental controls, advertisement blocking, and the information filtering features were not bundled with this release to reduce performance impact and disk space requirements. Instead, the features are available separately in 2007 add-on package. 
CNET reports mixed results in performance testing; however gains were made over the 2006 version. Warner also noted the 2007 version's reduced impact on system performance, compared to the 2006 version. Similar to the prior version, spam filtering module misidentified valid e-mail and missed actual spam, according to PC Magazine. 
Windows 2000 compatibility was dropped from this release. Compatibility with 32-bit editions of Windows Vista was introduced later in this release with a patch from Symantec. When installed in Vista, 350 MB of free space, an 800 MHz processor, and 512 MB of RAM is needed. When installed in Windows XP, 350 MB of free space, a 300 MHz processor, and 256 MB of RAM is required.
The 2008 version was released on August 28, 2007. New features include SONAR and the Norton Identity Safe. SONAR was designed using technologies Symantec acquired from WholeSecurity. The Identity Safe supersedes the information filtering function, storing webform information and can fill such forms. The information filtering feature is still available in the 2008 add-on package, and can be used in conjunction with the Identity Safe. 
When installed in 32-bit editions of Windows XP Service Pack 2, 350 MB of free space, a 300 MHz processor, and 256 MB of RAM is required. Support for 64-bit editions of Windows Vista was added in this release. 350 MB of free space, a 800 MHz processor, and 512 MB of RAM is required.
The 2009 version was released on September 8, 2008. Benchmarking conducted by PassMark Software highlights this release's 52 second install time, 32 second scan time, and 7 MB memory utilization. Symantec funded the benchmark test and provided scripts used to benchmark each participating antivirus software.
A single main interface replaces the tabs found in prior releases. New features include Norton Insight which whitelists files based on reputation, cutting scanning time. Virus signature updates are now delivered 5 to 15 minutes, supplementing the reliability tested updates issued by Symantec every several hours. However, such updates may incorrectly identify files as malicious, and users can elect not to receive those updates. Spam filtering was reintegrated in this release. The add-on package now includes information filtering and parental controls. The exploit scanner found in the 2007 and 2008 versions was dropped from this release. 
System requirements call for a 32-bit edition of Windows XP, a 300 MHz processor, 256 MB of RAM and 200 MB of free space. When installed in a 32 or 64-bit edition of Windows Vista, an 800 MHz processor, 512 MB of RAM, and 200 MB of free space is required.
Notable new features include the integration of Norton Safe Web, a web rating service. Safe Web blocks access to malicious sites. Additionally, search results from major search engine, such as Google, are color coded for safety (green for safe site, yellow for possibly unsafe site, red for dangerous sites, and gray with a white question mark for untested sites). The toolbar redirects queries to the Ask.com search engine, however does not share code with the Ask.com toolbar.
Norton Internet Security version 1.0 for Mac was released November 1, 2000. It can identify and remove both Windows and Mac viruses. Other features include a firewall, advertisement blocking in the browser, parental controls, and the ability to prevent confidential information from being transmitted outside the computer. Users are prompted before such information is able to be transmitted. The incorporation of Aladdin Systems' iClean allows users to purge the browser cache, cookies, and browsing history within Norton's interface. Operating system requirements call for Mac OS 8.1. Hardware requirements call for 24 MB of RAM, 12 MB of disk space, and a PowerPC processor.
Version 2.0 also ties in with the WHOIS database, allowing users to trace attacking computers. Users can inform network administrators of the attacking computers for corrective actions. When running under Mac OS 8.1 or 9, a PowerPC processor, 24 MB of RAM, and 25 MB of free space is required. Under Mac OS X 10.1, a PowerPC G3 processor, 128 MB of RAM, and 25 MB of free space is required.
The subsequent release, version 3.0, maintained the feature set found in version 2.0. The firewall now allocates internet access as needed rather than relying on user input using predefined rules. Compatibility with OS 8 was dropped. When running under OS 9.2, a PowerPC processor, 24 MB of RAM, and 25 MB of free space is required. Under OS X 10.1.5 through 10.3, a PowerPC G3, 128 MB of RAM, and 150 MB of free space is required. However, version 3.0 is not compatible with OS X 10.4, or "Tiger".
Version 4.0 was released on December 18, 2008. Symantec also markets a bundle of Version 4.0 and the 2009 version for Windows, intended for users with both Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installed. iClean was dropped from this release. The firewall now blocks access to malicious sites using a blacklist updated by Symantec. To prevent attackers from leveraging insecurities in the Mac or installed software, exploit protection was introduced in this release. Phishing protection was introduced in this release as well. Operating system requirements call for Mac OS X 10.4.11 or higher. Either a PowerPC or Intel Core processor, 256 MB of RAM and 150 MB of free space are required.
The FBI confirmed the active development of Magic Lantern, a keylogger intended to obtain passwords to encrypted e-mail as part of a criminal investigation. Magic Lantern was first reported in the media by Bob Sullivan of MSNBC on 20 November 2001 and by Ted Bridis of the Associated Press. The FBI intends to deploy Magic Lantern in the form of an e-mail attachment. When the attachment is opened, it installs a trojan horse on the suspect's computer. The trojan horse is activated when the suspect uses PGP encryption, often used to increase the security of sent e-mail messages. When activated, the trojan horse will log the PGP password, which allows the FBI to decrypt user communications. Symantec and other major antivirus vendors have whitelisted Magic Lantern, rendering their antivirus products, including Norton Internet Security, incapable of detecting Magic Lantern. Concerns include uncertainties about Magic Lantern's full potential and whether hackers could subvert it for purposes outside the jurisdiction of the law.
Graham Cluley, a technology consultant from Sophos, said "We have no way of knowing if it was written by the FBI, and even if we did, we wouldn’t know whether it was being used by the FBI or if it had been commandeered by a third party". Another reaction came from Marc Maiffret, chief technical officer and cofounder of eEye Digital Security, "Our customers are paying us for a service, to protect them from all forms of malicious code. It is not up to us to do law enforcement's job for them so we do not, and will not, make any exceptions for law enforcement malware or other tools."
FBI spokesman Paul Bresson, in response if Magic Lantern needed a court order to deploy, "Like all technology projects or tools deployed by the FBI it would be used pursuant to the appropriate legal process." Proponents of Magic Lantern argue the technology would allow law enforcement to efficiently and quickly decrypt messages protected by encryption schemes. Implementing Magic Lantern does not require physical access to a suspect's computer, unlike Carnivore, a predecessor to Magic Lantern, since physical access to a computer would require a court order.
In 2006, Oli Warner published two articles comparing the system performance impact of various Windows applications, including Norton Internet Security 2006. He later reran the experiments, revising his methodology and included 2007 version at Symantec's request. 
Warner benchmarked the processor and the disk performance with and without each application, compiling two scripts in C++, a programming language. One calculated all prime numbers between 100,000 and 200,000 and the other tested file read/write time. BootVis was used to measure boot time. All testing was conducted inside a virtualized environment created by VMware. Despite the 2007 version's improvements, Warner noted its significant boot delay and impact on file operations.
Recent testing conducted by PassMark Software found the 2009 version had the least impact on system performance. As noted earlier, Symantec funded the testing and provided some of the scripts used. Warner's scripts were also used to test file read/write time. The second and third ranked suites were ESET Smart Security 2008 and Kaspersky Internet Security 2009, respectively. Systems were benchmarked with a clean installation of Windows Vista, then again with a security suite installed. The 2009 version had the least impact on boot time, the fastest scan speed, lowest memory utilization, and the program itself installed the fastest out of its competitors. However, the 2009 version had the second most impact on file read/write time, as highlighted by Warner earlier.
Norton Internet Security (Windows versions) have been criticized for refusing to uninstall completely, leaving unnecessary files behind. Versions prior to 2009 installed a separate LiveUpdate program, which updates Norton-branded software. The user must uninstall both Norton Internet Security and the LiveUpdate component manually. The LiveUpdate component is purposely left behind to update other Norton-branded products, if present. In response, Symantec developed the Norton Removal Tool to remove leftover registry keys and values along with files and folders. Uninstallation will not remove subscription data, preserved to prevent users from installing multiple trial copies.
When Norton Internet Security 2008 is installed, users encountered incompatibilities upgrading to Windows XP Service Pack 3 or Windows Vista Service Pack 1. Users report numerous invalid registry keys being added by a tool named fixcss.exe, resulting in an empty Device Manager and missing devices such as wireless network adapters. Symantec initially blamed Microsoft for the incompatibilities but has since accepted partial responsibility.
Dave Cole, Symantec's senior director of product management, acknowledged that users running Norton products were experiencing problems, but said the numbers are small. Cole also said that Symantec had done "extensive testing" of its products with Windows XP SP3, but this issue had not surfaced. Cole essentially blamed Microsoft, "This is related to XP SP3," he stated. Microsoft recommended users to contact Windows customer support. To resolve the problem, Symantec has issued a fix intended for users before upgrading. Symantec also recommends disabling the tamper protection component in the 2008 release, dubbed SymProtect. A tool to remove the added registry entries is also available from Symantec.
Sarah Hicks, Symantec's vice president of consumer product management, voiced concern over Windows Vista 64-bit's PatchGuard feature. PatchGuard was designed by Microsoft to ensure the integrity of the kernel, a part of a operating system which interacts with the hardware. Rootkits often hide in a operating system's kernel, complicating removal. Mike Dalton, European president of McAfee said, "The decision to build a wall around the kernel with the assumption it can't be breached is ridiculous", claiming Microsoft was preventing security vendors from effectively protecting the kernel while promoting its own security product, Windows Live OneCare. Hicks said Symantec did not mind the competition from OneCare. Symantec later published a white paper detailing PatchGuard with instructions to obtain a PatchGuard exploit. After negotiations and investigations from antitrust regulators, Microsoft decided to allow security vendors access to the kernel by creating special API instructions.

Gateshead F.C.

Gateshead F.C. is an association football team who are from North East England. They are an professional club.
Their supporters, known as Tynesiders, number in the hundreds.
During the early years of the English Football League, South Shields played in the league, finishing as high as sixth in the Second Division. However problems with money saw them move the short distance between to Gateshead. Gateshead became an established team in the Football League's bottom division, coming close to promotion twice. But in 1960, they were controversially voted out of the league, to be replaced by Peterborough United F.C.. The team never really recovered and entered administration in 1974.
A successor to Gateshead were soon founded, and attempted to join the Scottish Football League, but they did not get enough votes. This new team also went out of business. But once again, the people of South Shields saved Gateshead and in 1977 the current Gateshead side moved to the town. Gateshead have since moved between the Northern Premier League and the Football Conference. Under Gary Mills, they were able to reach the playoff final but Cambridge beat them to end their hopes of return to the League. Since then a more mellow patch followed.

Fun and Fancy Free

Fun and Fancy Free is a 1947 American animated musical buddy comedy movie. It was produced by Walt Disney. It was released on September 27, 1947 by RKO Radio Pictures. It is the 9th movie in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series and the fourth of the "package movies" (feature-length compilations of shorter segments) the studio produced in the 1940s in order to save money during World War II. The movie features two stories. The first story, "Bongo", is hosted by Jiminy Cricket and narrated by Dinah Shore. Based on the tale "Little Bear Bongo" by Sinclair Lewis, "Bongo" tells the story of a circus bear cub named Bongo who longs for freedom from captivity. Bongo escapes the circus and eventually forms a romantic relationship with a female bear cub named Lulubelle in the wild, realizing that he must prove himself in order to earn Lulubelle as his mate. The second story, "Mickey and the Beanstalk", is hosted by Edgar Bergen and is a retelling of "Jack and the Beanstalk" featuring Mickey, Donald, and Goofy as three pheasants who discover the temperamental Willie the Giant's castle in the sky through the use of some magic beans. They must battle the greedy but lovable giant in order to restore peace to their valley. "Mickey and the Beanstalk" was the last time Walt Disney voiced Mickey Mouse, because he was too busy on other projects to continue voicing the famous character. Disney replaced himself with sound effects artist Jimmy MacDonald.
The movie was released on September 27, 1947. It enjoyed fairly decent reception. The Disney package movies of the late 1940s helped finance "Cinderella", and subsequent others, such as "Alice in Wonderland" and "Peter Pan".

Endorheic basin

An endorheic basin, also called an internal drainage system, is a drainage basin, or watershed, that does not flow to one of the Earth's major oceans. This is unlike normal basins that collect in rivers and flow to the ocean. Endorheic basins usually end in a saline lake or a salt flat. They can be found in all parts of the world, but usually in desert locations.
Endorheic lakes in Antarctica are located in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Victoria Land, Antarctica, the largest ice-free area in Antarctica.
Much of western and Central Asia is a single, giant inland basin. It contains several lakes, including:
Australia, being very dry and having exceedingly low runoff ratios due to its ancient soils, has a great prominence of variable, endorheic drainages. The most important are:
Many small lakes and ponds in North Dakota and Manitoba are endorheic; some of them have salt encrustations along their shores.
All these lakes are drained, however, either through manmade canals or via karstic phenomena.
Minor additional endorheic lakes exist throughout the Mediterranean countries Spain (e.g. Laguna de Gallocanta), Italy, Cyprus (Larnaca and Akrotiri salt lakes) and Greece.

The Great Salt Lake is a very large saltwater lake in the United States. It is in the state of Utah. It is an endorheic lake, meaning that the water in it does not flow to the ocean. It is one of the biggest endorheic lakes in the world. The lake is in the Great Basin, a large area of desert terrain covering parts of the states of Nevada, Utah, Idaho, California, and Arizona. It is many times saltier than the average of the world's oceans.
The lake is about long and wide. Its surface area averages , but because of its desert location, its size changes very often. The three major rivers that flow into it are the Jordan, Weber, and Bear rivers. Because of its similarity to the Dead Sea in Asia, it has been called "America's Dead Sea".

<doc id="176458" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176458" title="Hyperbolic geometry">
Hyperbolic geometry

In mathematics, hyperbolic geometry is a non-Euclidean geometry, meaning that the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry is replaced. The parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry says that in two dimensional space, for any given line "l" and point "P" not on "l", there is exactly one line through "P" that does not intersect "l". This line is called "parallel" to "l". In hyperbolic geometry there are at least two such lines through "P". As they do not intersect "l", the parallel postulate is false. Models have been constructed within Euclidean geometry that obey the axioms of hyperbolic geometry. These models prove that the parallel postulate is independent of the other postulates of Euclid.
Because there is no hyperbolic analogue to Euclidean parallel lines, the hyperbolic use of "parallel" and related terms varies among writers. In this article, the two limiting lines are called "asymptotic" and lines that have a common perpendicular are called "ultraparallel"; the simple word "parallel" may apply to both.
An interesting property of hyperbolic geometry follows from the occurrence of more than one parallel line through a point "P": there are two classes of non-intersecting lines. Let "B" be the point on "l" such that the line "PB" is perpendicular to "l". Consider the line "x" through "P" such that "x" does not intersect "l", and the angle θ between "PB" and "x" counterclockwise from "PB" is as small as possible; i.e., any smaller angle will force the line to intersect "l". This is called an asymptotic line in hyperbolic geometry. Symmetrically, the line "y" that forms the same angle θ between "PB" and itself but clockwise from "PB" will also be asymptotic. "x" and "y" are the only two lines asymptotic to "l" through "P". All other lines through "P" not intersecting "l", with angles greater than θ with "PB", are called ultraparallel (or disjointly parallel) to "l". Notice that since there are an infinite number of possible angles between θ and 90 degrees, and each one will determine two lines through "P" and disjointly parallel to "l", there exist an infinite number of ultraparallel lines.
Thus we have this modified form of the parallel postulate: In hyperbolic geometry, given any line "l", and point "P" not on "l", there are exactly two lines through "P" which are asymptotic to "l", and infinitely many lines through "P" ultraparallel to "l".
The differences between these types of lines can also be looked at in the following way: the distance between asymptotic lines run to zero in one direction and grows without bound in the other; the distance between ultraparallel lines increases in both directions. The ultraparallel theorem states that there is a "unique" line in the hyperbolic plane that is perpendicular to each of a given pair of ultraparallel lines.
In Euclidean geometry, the "angle of parallelism" is a constant; that is, any distance formula_1 between parallel lines yields an angle of parallelism equal to 90°. In hyperbolic geometry, the angle of parallelism varies with the formula_2 function. This function, described by Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky, produces a unique angle of parallelism for each distance formula_3. As the distance gets shorter, formula_2 approaches 90°, whereas with increasing distance formula_2 approaches 0°. Thus, as distances get smaller, the hyperbolic plane behaves more and more like Euclidean geometry. Indeed, on small scales compared to formula_6, where formula_7 is the (constant) Gaussian curvature of the plane, an observer would have a hard time determining whether he is in the Euclidean or the hyperbolic plane.
A number of geometers made attempts to prove the parallel postulate, including Omar Khayyám, and later Giovanni Gerolamo Saccheri, John Wallis, Lambert, and Legendre. Their attempts failed, but their efforts gave birth to hyperbolic geometry. The theorems of Alhacen, Khayyam on quadrilaterals, were the first theorems on hyperbolic geometry. Their works on hyperbolic geometry had an influence on its development among later European geometers, including Witelo, Alfonso and John Wallis.
In the nineteenth century, hyperbolic geometry was explored by János Bolyai and Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky, after whom it sometimes is named. Lobachevsky published in 1830, while Bolyai independently discovered it and published in 1832. Karl Friedrich Gauss also studied hyperbolic geometry, describing in a 1824 letter to Taurinus that he had constructed it, but did not publish his work. In 1868, Eugenio Beltrami provided models of it, and used this to prove that hyperbolic geometry was consistent if Euclidean geometry was.
The term "hyperbolic geometry" was introduced by Felix Klein in 1871. For more history, see article on non-Euclidean geometry.
There are three models commonly used for hyperbolic geometry: the Klein model, the Poincaré disc model, and the Lorentz model, or hyperboloid model. These models define a real hyperbolic space which satisfies the axioms of a hyperbolic geometry.
Despite the naming, the two disc models and the half-plane model were introduced as models of hyperbolic space by Beltrami, not by Poincaré or Klein.
M. C. Escher's famous prints "Circle Limit III" and "Circle Limit IV"
illustrate the conformal disc model quite well. In both one can see the geodesics. (In "III" the white lines are not geodesics, but hypercycles, which run alongside them.) It is also possible to see quite plainly the negative curvature of the hyperbolic plane, through its effect on the sum of angles in triangles and squares.
In the Euclidean plane, their angles would sum to 450°; i.e., a circle and a quarter. From this we see that the sum of angles of a triangle in the hyperbolic plane must be smaller than 180°. Another visible property is exponential growth. In "Circle Limit IV", for example, one can see that the number of angels and demons within a distance of "n" from the center rises exponentially. The demons have equal hyperbolic area, so the area of a ball of radius "n" must rise exponentially in "n".
There are several ways to physically realize a hyperbolic plane (or approximation thereof). A particularly well-known paper model based on the pseudosphere is due to William Thurston. The art of crochet has been used to demonstrate hyperbolic planes with the first being made by Daina Taimina. In 2000, Keith Henderson demonstrated a quick-to-make paper model dubbed the "hyperbolic soccerball".

<doc id="176468" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176468" title="Parallel postulate">
Parallel postulate

In geometry the parallel postulate is one of the axioms of Euclidean geometry. Sometimes it is also called Euclid's fifth postulate, because it is the fifth postulate in Euclid's Elements.
The postulate says that: 
"if you cut a line segment with two lines, and the two interior angles the lines form add up to less than two right angles, then the two lines will eventually meet if you extend them long enough."
The field of geometry which follows all of Euclid's axioms is called Euclidean geometry. Geometries which do not follow all of Euclid's axioms are called non-Euclidean geometry.
Some mathematicians thought that Euclid's fifth postulate was much longer and more complicated than the other four postulates. Many of them thought that it could be proven from the other simpler axioms. Some mathematicians announced they had proven the proposition from the simpler propositions, but they all turned out to be mistaken. Euclid is also known as Euclid of Alexandria.
Another more recent proposition known as "Playfair's axiom" is similar to Euclid's fifth postulate. It says that:
"Given a straight line and a point not on this line, you can only draw one straight line through this point that will not meet the other straight line."
In fact, mathematicians found out that this axiom is not only similar to Euclid's fifth postulate, but has exactly the same implications. Mathematically, the two propositions are called 'equivalent' propositions. Today Playfair's axiom is used more often by mathematicians than Euclid's original parallel postulate.
Eventually some mathematicians tried to build new geometries without using the axiom. One of these new geometries is now called elliptic geometry. In elliptic geometry the parallel postulate is replaced by an axiom that states that:
"Given a straight line and a point not on this line, you cannot draw a straight line through this point that will not eventually cross the other straight line."
Mathematicians found that when they replaced Euclid's fifth postulate with this axiom, they were still able to prove many of Euclid's other theorems. This formed a new geometry called "elliptic geometry."
One way to imagine elliptic geometry is by thinking of the surface of a globe. On a globe, lines of longitude appear to be parallel at the equator, but they all meet at the poles.
Elliptic geometry was shown to be consistent. This proved that Euclid's fifth postulate was independent of the other postulates. After this, mathematicians mostly stopped trying to prove the fifth postulate from the other four postulates. Instead, many mathematicians began studying other geometries that do not follow Euclid's fifth postulate.
Another axiom mathematicians sometimes replace Euclid's fifth axiom with says that:
"Given a straight line and a point not on this line, you can draw at least two straight lines through this point that will not eventually cross the other straight line."
This is called "hyperbolic geometry".
Another geometry simply removes Euclid's fifth postulate and does not replace it with anything. This is called "neutral geometry" or "absolute geometry".

Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime which are created whenever objects with mass move. They were predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916 on the basis of his theory of general relativity. As gravitational waves are not created from stationary objects, they must be detected from moving systems. Sources of detectable gravitational waves include binary star systems composed of white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. 
On February 11, 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had directly detected gravitational waves from a pair of black holes merging. 
In physics, gravitational waves are ripples in the curvature of spacetime that travel outward from the source. Albert Einstein predicted them in 1916 on the basis of his theory of general relativity. In theory, gravitational waves transport energy as gravitational radiation. 
In general relativity, gravitational waves cannot travel faster than the speed of light. They do not exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, in which physical interactions propagate at infinite speed. However, the detection of gravitational waves proves the last prediction of Einstein’s general theory of relativity.
In 1993, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for measurements of the Hulse-Taylor binary star system that suggests gravitational waves are more than mathematical anomalies.

Twelfth Night

Twelfth Night, Or What You Will is a play written by William Shakespeare. It is a comedy.
Orsino, the Duke of lllyria, is in love with the Countess Olivia. She is not dating men for seven years because of the death of her brother, so she turns him down. Meanwhile, Viola was shipwrecked in Illyria but she has been rescued by a captain. She has lost her twin brother, Sebastian. She dresses herself as a boy and uses the name Cesario, so she can get work as a page for Orsino. As Orsino's page, Viola is sent to Olivia with love letters. Viola finds out, to her dismay, that Olivia has fallen for her (as a boy) rather than Duke Orsino. Also, Viola has already fallen in love with the Duke.
Sebastian (Viola's twin, thought to be dead) comes ashore in Illyria. He thinks Viola has drowned in the shipwreck. A man named Antonio has rescued him from the surf; at some risk to himself, because Antonio fought against the Duke at one time. Meanwhile, in Olivia's house, Sir Toby Belch (her uncle) has tricked Sir Andrew Aguecheek into supporting him, by convincing him that he could be a suitor for Olivia. So with the help of Maria, Olivia's maid, and Feste, a clown, Belch plots to make a fool of the steward. Maria writes a love letter to Malvolio that will make him think Olivia has fallen for him. Malvolio falls for the joke and dresses crazily as the letter says to. Not knowing it is a joke, the Countess is horrified and has Malvolio locked away as a madman. 
Belch tries to get Sir Andrew to fight a duel with Viola's "Cesario" character as she leaves but Olivia has a crush on Cesario. Viola and Sir Andrew prepare for a duel that neither one wants. Antonio intervenes to defend Cesario, because he thinks he is his friend Sebastian, and is arrested for piracy against Orsino. Olivia has become engaged to Sebastian. Viola still does not recognize Antonio. Later, Belch and Sir Andrew talk to Sebastian, who does not back down from Aguecheek when challenged and beats him in the duel. Meanwhile, Olivia has met and become engaged to Sebastian.
Antonio is brought before the Duke for questioning, and Viola tells all about the duel. Antonio tells everyone how he dragged "this man" from the surf, saving his life. Then Olivia comes in, searching for her new husband, which she thinks is Viola. Adding to this confusion, Belch and Aguecheek enter claiming that Viola/Cesario has violently assaulted them. In the midst of Viola's denials, Sebastian shows up. The brother and sister recognize one another and are reunited. Sebastian helps to explain the confusion over who fought and married who. 
In the end, Orsino and Viola are in love. Olivia and Sebastian are happily wed, and Olivia fusses at Belch and Maria for their abuse of Malvolio, who vows to get even. Belch agrees to wed Maria to make up for getting her in trouble. Everyone, except unhappy Malvolio, lives happily ever after. Orsino welcomes Olivia and Sebastian and he now realises he is attracted to Cesario. He promises to marry her as soon as she is dressed as a woman again.

Quokka

The quokka, "Setonix brachyurus", is a small marsupial about the size of a large cat. Like other animals in the macropod family, such as kangaroos and wallabies, the quokka eats grass and small plants, and is mainly nocturnal. It lives on some small islands off the coast of Western Australia, mainly on Rottnest Island near Perth, and Bald Island near Albany. A small number live on the main land in the protected area of Two Peoples Bay, which they share with Gilbert's Potoroo. The quokka is the only member of the genus "Setonix".
The quokka weighs between and . It is around long with a tail. This is short for a macropod. It has a solid build, rounded ears, and a short, broad head. It looks like a very small, fat kangaroo, but it can climb small trees and shrubs. It has rough fur which is a brown colour, fading to pale brown underneath. The quokka eats a small amount of its waste products.
It is about the size of a domestic cat.
The quokka is a social animal and lives in large groups. They eat grass, sedges, succulents and leaves. They can become very sick if fed with things like bread, given to them by visitors to Rottnest Island. Visitors are now told not to feed them. Quokkas breed at any time on the mainland, but in late summer on Rottnest. The female quokka has two babies (called "joeys") in a year. 
The quokka moves in the same way as a kangaroo, using both small and large hops.
Quokkas are not scared of people, so you are able to get quite close to them, particularly on Rottnest Island. It is against the law on Rottnest Island to handle or touch the animals in any way. A A$100 fine can be given by the Rottnest Island Authority for picking up a quokka. People can even be taken to court and get a fine of up to $1000. These fines have been used in some unusual cases where quokka have been hurt or killed by visitors to Rottnest.
There are a lot of quokkas living on the small offshore islands, because this is only a small area they are listed as vulnerable. On the mainland, they are attacked by dingoes, as well as introduced animals like foxes, dogs and cats. They also need thick ground cover for shelter. Farming has cleared much of the land which is another reason the species is threatened.
The quokka was one of the first Australian mammals seen by Europens. The Dutch sailor, Samuel Volckertzoon wrote about seeing a "a wild cat" on Rottnest Island in 1658. In 1696, Willem de Vlamingh thought they were rats and named the island "Rottenest", Dutch for "rat nest".
The word "quokka" is comes from a Nyungar word, which was probably "gwaga".

For simplicity only major place names and lines are given, to help locate the stations. A line listed may neither serve passengers nor access platforms. Two lines are given for a station only if they do not connect and are not essentially collinear. Each station's linked article gives more detailed information, including services.
Repeated links (overlinkage) in this, a list, allows finding linked articles and expanding abbreviations without scrolling searches.

Official names by this site for Blackfriars, Waterloo East and eleven absolute termini (which means "route ends") (not Moorgate) all start with "London". The thirteen are prefixed with asterisks in the list. Programs such as Travel planners require the "London" inconsistently. Queenstown Road is labelled "Queenstown Road (Battersea)" on maps and timetables, though its name is unique within London.

Scientology teaches that Xenu (pronounced ( (ZEE-noo)) was the dictator of a galactic confederacy of 76 planets, who was captured and imprisoned on Earth 75 million years ago after bringing billions of his people to Earth, placing them around volcanoes and killing them by using hydrogen bombs. Scientologists believe he is still being kept there these days. Xenu is very important to the beliefs of Scientology because the story of Xenu explains the believed origin of what are known as body thetans from humans. Body thetans are believed to be the essence of Xenu's people that gather around humans and cause them spiritual harm. It is the purpose of auditing within Scientology to remove these thetans from the Scientologist.
The existence of Xenu has been reported by L. Ron Hubbard's writings and by Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis in an interview ABC affiliate KESQ-TV.

Earth science (also known as geoscience), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth. It is a special case in planetary science, the Earth being the only known life-bearing planet. The formal discipline of Earth sciences may include the study of the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere, as well as the solid earth. Typically Earth scientists will use tools from physics, chemistry, biology, chronology and mathematics to understand how the Earth system works, and how it evolved to its current state. (enWP)

Henry the Young King

Henry the Young King (28 February 1155 – near Limoges, France, 11 June 1183) was the junior king to his father Henry II of England. He was crowned king in 1170, but never actually used the power. The meaning of this is that Henry II's territory covered much of northern France as well as England and Ireland. The idea may have been to have an official deputy for legal actions when Henry was in France, and to indicate the succession to the throne. In practice, Young Henry was not interested in government. According to his tutor, William Marshal, he spent his time in France going from one knights' tournament to another.
The boy was married as a child to Marguerite of France (1158–1197), daughter of the French King Louis VII. The intention was political, but it did not work. War came between Henry II and Louis. Henry joined in rebellions directed at his father. A civil war (1173/74) occurred in which Young Henry and his mother, with Scots and French support, fought against Henry II. The king won, just. Young Henry died ten years later, of dysentery. As he died before his father he never achieved power.

Rod cells are one of two types of photoreceptor cells that can be found in the retina of the eyes of humans, as well as other animals. The other type are the cone cells, of which there are about 7 million in the human eye. Rod cells are very sensitive to light. They allow night vision. They are concentrated at the edge of the retina, where they also allow peripheral vision. There are about 125 million of them in the human eye.

Three Gorges Dam

The Three Gorges Dam () is a dam in the Three Gorges region on the Yangtze River in Sandouping, in the country of China. One of the largest dams in the world, it also generates the biggest amount of hydroelectric power (22,250 megawatts), pushing the massive Itaipu Dam in Brazil from first place to second place. The Three Gorges Dam project was completed on July 4, 2012. The dam was built for flood control, irrigation, and electricity. However, this has not come without problems. The dam covers a lot of historic sites and has caused 1.24 million people to lose their homes under the rising water. The dam forms the Three Gorges Reservoir, which extends nearly upstream to the city of Chongqing.
The dam was proposed by Sun Yat-sen, a Chinese political leader, in 1919. The site was surveyed in 1932 and 1939, by the Chinese and Japanese respectively. The Japanese drew up a plan (the Otani plan) for the dam, only to realize later that China would remain under Chinese control. Later, in 1944, the United States helped make plans for the dam, but all work on the dam stopped in 1947, because of the Chinese Civil War. In 1949, work resumed, but the work was slow because of problems in the economy. Later in 1958, some engineers who were against the dam were put in jail.
In 1980, work on the dam continued faster. But many people voted in 1992 against the dam. However, the dam was accepted by the government, and on December 14, 1994, construction began. In 2009, the dam began to make hydroelectricity. Some new plans, such as a set of 6 new power generators under construction, became operational in the year 2011. The reservoir filled to capacity at the end of 2008.
The Three Gorges Dam consists of a main dam wall, and a section on the right with a set of five locks, which are devices used to raise boats and ships. 
The dam cost $180 billion Chinese Yuan Renminbi (about $30 billion USD). While this cost seems huge, it actually was $20 million yuan (about $3.3 billion USD) less than the original budget of $203.9 billion yuan (about $34 billion USD). However, this cost will be recovered when the dam makes money by making electricity. In about 10 years, the complete cost of the dam will be recovered.
One of the big reasons the dam was built to control floods. It protects large cities like Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai, which are very close to the river. Lots of farms, small villages and towns, and factories are also located near the river. In the event of a flood, there are 22 cubic kilometers (18 million acre feet) of space behind the dam to hold back the flood waters. The flood waters are stored behind the dam for future use. In the dry season, the water is released down the river, and the reservoir level drops to prepare for the next flood. However, the dam does not protect the lower river tributaries from flooding.
Another reason the dam was built was for water navigation, or the transport of people and goods by ship. There are two sets of canal locks, each of which has five stages. Each lock is long, wide, and deep, which is comparable in size to the locks of the Panama Canal, one of the biggest canals in the world. The reservoir behind the dam floods a lot of dangerous sections of the river, which makes it easier for boats and ships to sail. There is also a "ship lift" (an elevator for ships) that can lift ships that weigh up to 3,000 tons.
The Three Gorges Dam generates 22,250 megawatts, which makes it the biggest single hydroelectric power source in the world. It has 34 electricity generators, and 32 are main generators. Each generator is powered by water that comes from the reservoir. Each of these 32 generators makes about 700 megawatts of electricity. (This is more electricity than the entire electricity generation of Glen Canyon Dam, one of the biggest dams in the United States.) The other two generators will make power for the dam itself. These two generators each make 50 megawatts.
Of the 32 main generators, 14 generators are on the north side of the dam. 12 are on the south side of the dam. 6 are in a separate powerhouse under a mountain just south of the dam. The generating capacity of the dam is 10,000 MWh (megawatt-hours), or the amount of megawatts generated per hour. Each main generator weighs a massive 6000 tons (about the same weight as three thousand cars). The water drops from the reservoir to the generator, which uses a type of turbine called a "Francis turbine". Each turbine is wide and tall. The amount of water that goes into the turbine can be from 1,968 cubic feet (600 m) to 3,116 cubic feet (950 m) per second. The turbines turn at a speed of 75 RPM (rotations per minute). The efficiency of the generators is from 94 to 96.5 percent.
The 14 main generators on the north side were installed from 2003 to 2005. The first one to begin making electricity (Generator No.2) started on July 10, 2003. The last one (Generator No.9) started on September 7, 2005. The full power (9,800 megawatts) of the north side generators was first tested on October 18, 2006, when the reservoir had risen to above sea level. The 12 main generators on the south side were installed from 2007 to 2008. The first one to begin making electricity (Generator No.22) started on June 11, 2007. The last one (Generator No.23) started on August 19, 2008.
From its completion to March 2009, the Three Gorges Dam has generated about 296,550,000 MWh (Megawatt-hours) of electricity. 
Three power lines send electricity away from the dam, to three electricity grids called the East, Central, and South China grids.
The dam provides about 3% of China's electricity. However, the dam was originally planned to supply 10% of China's electricity. The reason for the decrease is, China's energy use grew much faster than the designers expected.
Because of reducing electricity needs on fossil fuels like coal and oil, the Three Gorges Dam has saved 31 million tons of coal per year, and prevented:
The dam has also benefited transportation on the river. Because of the locks (devices used to lift ships) installed on the dam, the benefits are:
In response to the dam, many sewage pipes that once dumped sewage straight into the Yangtze River now have to be treated. Over 65 percent of this waste water is now treated before flowing into the reservoir. There are now about 50 water treatment facilities in the area. Also, solid waste is now collected in 32 landfills. They can handle 7,664.5 tons of waste every day.
The dam also persuaded the government of China to think seriously about the pollution in the Yangtze River and the rest of China.
A total of 1.24 million people had to move to different places because their homes were flooded by the dam. This number is about 1.5% of the total population of Hubei Province (60.3 million) and Chongqing City (31.44 million) where the reservoir is located. 140,000 from Hubei Province alone. 
On July 22, 2008, most of the people were safely relocated. 4 million more people will ultimately have to move to Chongqing from their homes near the Three Gorges Dam. 
A large amount of animal habitat has also been destroyed. Many animals with critically low populations have lost their vital habitat. These include the endangered Siberian Crane, the Yangtze river dolphin (baiji), and Yangtze sturgeon. About one billion tons of dirty water flow into the Yangtze River each year. The dam has stopped this dirty water from being washed away, and led to serious pollution problems.
About 1,300 historic sites have been flooded by the Three Gorges reservoir. The Three Gorges will be turned into much less spectacular gorges because the water level will rise up to in places, reducing the depth of the canyons. 
Many of these historic sites have been moved to safer places. But some historic sites cannot be moved because of their location, size, or design.
A lot of silt (sediment) that is carried by the river has been trapped in the reservoir. Eventually, if the dam is not removed, the reservoir will fill with silt, making it useless. Also, because the river's silt doesn't go downstream anymore, the city of Shanghai will suffer because there has been no silt to replace land that is washed away at the river's mouth. In a high-silt content river like the Yangtze, sediment can clog the dam's outlets, and it cannot release water. The water would back up behind the dam and have nowhere to go, and would eventually go over the dam, making it collapse.
The dam is also a possible target in war, weakening China's national security. It is also possible that the dam sits on a seismic fault.
The Gezhouba Dam (Gezhouba Water Control Project, Chinese: 长江葛洲坝水利枢纽工程) is an afterbay (smaller dam in front) of the Three Gorges Dam. It forms a pool that extends upstream to the base of the Three Gorges Dam, improving navigation. The dam was built from December 30, 1970 to December 10, 1988. The dam is long and up to tall. It generates 2,710 megawatts of electricity. There are three ship locks at the dam. Lock No.2, which is long, wide, and deep, is among the 100 largest in the world.
A series of other dams are also planned upstream, on the Yangtze and Jinsha rivers. About four dams are planned on the stretch of the Yangtze River, and they will produce 38,500 megawatts in total. Eight dams are planned on the Jinsha River, and eight more upstream of it, and one original plan called for a dam in the Tiger Leaping Gorge, one of the deepest river canyons in the world. This plan was, however, scrapped in December 21, 2007, because of the gorge's status as a World Heritage site.

Ericaceae is a family of flowering plants in the order Ericales. Plants of this family grow both in Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere. The common English name of Ericaceae is "heath family".
Many plants of Ericaceae are shrubs, but there are also trees and herbs.
There are about 120 genera and about 4000 species in this family.
Many plants of Ericaceae are evergreen plants with small flowers in the shape of bells or tube. The color of flowers may be white, pink, red, violet, rarely yellow. It may be interest plants for gardens.
Fruits of some species are edible.
Some plants of Ericaceae have a poison in all their parts.
The genus "Epacris" was treated in a separate family, Epacridaceae, but "Epacris" is now in this family.<br style="clear:left">

Alternation of generations

The term alternation of generations is used to describe a process in the life cycle of some eukaryotes. It describes an alternation in forms which occurs in plants and some protists. One form is diploid, with 2"n" chromosomes: the sporophyte. The other form is haploid with only one set of chromosomes: the gametophyte. Both forms are multicellular.
In sexual reproduction, organisms have a haploid phase with one set of chromosomes and a diploid phase with two sets of chromosomes. In animals the body (soma) is usually diploid, while the haploid stage is only the gametes. In other eukaryotes alternation of generations may occur. It means that both the diploid and the haploid phases are multi-cellular organisms. The classic example is the mosses, where the green plant is a haploid gametophyte, and the reproductive phase is the diploid sporophyte. The two forms often occur together, as shown in the illustration on the right
The term "alternation of generations" refers only to the sexual cycle; organisms often have asexual reproduction as well. The term should not be confused with life cycle stages in animals, which may look very different, but where all cells have two sets of chromosomes.
The alternation of generations is an important concept in the evolution of plants. All land plants have alternation of generations.
In mosses and their relatives (Bryophytes), the haploid gametophyte is the dominant generation, and the diploid sporophytes are sporangium-bearing stalks growing from the gametophytes. In ferns, the diploid sporophyte is much larger, but the haploid gametophyte is also a little plant that can grow for a long time.
For flowering plants ("Angiosperms"), the sporophyte generation is almost the whole life cycle (the green plant, roots etc.) except the small reproductive structures (pollen and ovule).
The sporophyte produces spores (hence the name), by meiosis. These develop into a gametophyte. Both the spores and the resulting gametophyte are haploid, meaning they have half as many chromosomes. Later, the mature gametophyte produces male or female gametes (or both) by mitosis. The fusion of male and female gametes (fertilization) produces a diploid zygote which develops into a new sporophyte. This is the cycle which is known as alternation of generations or alternation of phases.
In the landmark work "Variation and evolution in plants", Stebbins discussed how alternation of generations related to the overall evolution of plants. He began:
Later Stebbins comments:
The point is that, in diploids, new alleles are sheltered and (collectively) they are a reservoir of potential variation in the population.
Most algae have dominant gametophyte generations, but in some species the gametophytes and sporophytes are morphologically similar (isomorphic). 
Bryophytes (mosses, liverworts and hornworts) have a dominant gametophyte stage on which the adult sporophyte is dependent on the gametophyte for nutrition. The sporophyte develops from the zygote inside the female sex organ, so its early development is nurtured by the gametophyte.
An independent sporophyte is the dominant form in all clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms (flowering plants) that have survived to the present day. 
Early land plants had sporophytes that produced identical spores: they looked the same whichever sex they developed into. The ancestors of the gymnosperms evolved complex heterosporous life cycles: the spores producing male and female gametophytes were of different sizes. The female "megaspores" tending to be larger, and fewer in number, than the male "microspores". 
During the Devonian, several plant groups independently evolved "heterospory" and later "endospory", in which single megaspores were kept inside the sporangia of the parent sporophyte. These endosporic megaspores had a miniature multicellular female gametophyte with female sex organs and egg cells. The ova were fertilised by free-swimming sperm produced by windborne miniatuarised male gametophytes in the form of pre-pollen. 
The resulting zygote developed into the next sporophyte generation while still inside the single large female megaspore in the sporangium of the parent sporophyte. The evolution of heterospory and endospory were among the earliest steps in the evolution of seeds of the kind produced by gymnosperms and angiosperms.
Some Chromalveolata, some fungi and some slime moulds have what seems to be genuine alternation of generations. These groups include such a wide range of different types that lt is difficult to say how common the phenomenon is. Certainly slime moulds are not a monophyletic group, and that may be true of the other two groups, 
Alternation of generations between a multicellular diploid and a multicellular haploid generation does not exist in animals. 
In some animals, there is a life cycle with different diploid stages. This has sometimes mistakenly been called "alternation of generations", but is quite different from what happens in plants and some protists. The most common case is that there are two distinct generations, where only one has sexual reproduction. Animals where it has been found include the Cnidaria and the Tunicates. The images on the right show the case of jellyfish: The medusa looks different from the polyp; they are different phenotypes. Only the medusa reproduces sexually. 
Other animals with life cycle forms include parasites such as certain flukes, which live in different snails for one part of their life, and in vertebrates for another part. 
In some cases, the cycle includes more than two generations. If this is the case, only one stage uses sexual reproduction. In aphids, for example, there is one generation that reproduces sexually, and up to forty that use parthenogenesis, a type of asexual reproduction.

John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster

John of Gaunt (John Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Aquitaine, 6 March 1340 – 3 February 1399) was a member of the House of Plantagenet, who ruled England for over 300 years. Gaunt was the third surviving son of Edward II and Philippa of Hainault. He was the father of Henry IV.
Gaunt was a younger brother of Edward, the Black Prince. He had great influence over the English throne during the childhood of his nephew, Richard II, and during the ensuing periods of political strife. He is not thought to have been an opponent of the king.
John of Gaunt's legitimate male heirs, the Lancasters, included Kings Henry IV, Henry V, and Henry VI. His other legitimate children included, by his first wife Blanche, his daughters Philippa of Portugal and Elizabeth, Duchess of Exeter; and by his second wife Constance, his daughter Queen Catherine of Castile.
John fathered five children outside marriage, one early in life by a lady-in-waiting to his mother, and four by Katherine Swynford, Gaunt's long-term mistress and third wife. These were surnamed Beaufort (after a former French possession of the Duke). The Beaufort children, three sons and a daughter, were legitimised by royal and papal decrees after John and Katherine married in 1396. Their half-brother Henry IV added a later proviso that they were barred from inheriting the throne.
Descendants of this marriage included Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester and eventually Cardinal; Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland, grandmother of Kings Edward IV and Richard III; John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, the great-grandfather of King Henry VII; and Joan Beaufort, Queen of Scots, from whom are descended, beginning in 1437, all subsequent sovereigns of Scotland, and successively, from 1603 on, the sovereigns of England, of Great Britain and Ireland, and of the United Kingdom to the present day. The three succeeding houses of English sovereigns from 1399 — the Houses of Lancaster, York and Tudor — were descended from John through Henry Bolingbroke, Joan Beaufort and John Beaufort, respectively.
Lancaster's eldest son and heir, Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Hereford, was exiled for ten years by King Richard II in 1398 as resolution to a dispute between Hereford and Thomas de Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.
When John of Gaunt died in 1399, his estates and titles were declared forfeit to the crown as King Richard II named Hereford a traitor and commuted his sentence to exile for life. Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile to reclaim his inheritance and depose Richard. Bolingbroke then reigned as King Henry IV of England (1399–1413), the first of the descendants of John of Gaunt to hold the throne of England.
Due to some generous land grants, John was not only one of the richest men in his era, but also one of the wealthiest men to have ever lived. Taking into account inflation rates, John was worth a modern equivalent of $110 billion, making him the sixteenth richest man in history.

Guinea (British coin)

A guinea is a coin that was minted in the Kingdom of England between 1663 and 1813. It is not used any more.
Although guinea coins had not been made for a long time, prices often continued to be shown in guineas until British prices became decimal in 1971. A guinea was worth £1,1s0d (one pound and one shilling). This is the same as £1.05p in modern money.
Because a guinea was close to a pound, putting prices in guineas made the price seem less. A price of 39 guineas might look like "about £39". In fact it is nearly £41.

<doc id="176937" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176937" title="Chorale">
Chorale

A chorale (pronounce: "Ko-RAHL") is a hymn which is sung in a Lutheran church by all the people. Chorales developed during the late Renaissance and early Baroque period. Most of them were written at that time.
Martin Luther thought that the congregation (people worshipping in church) should have music to sing that was not too difficult. He thought that the words should be in German instead of Latin so that everybody would understand what they were singing about. Luther wrote the words of many chorales himself. He even composed some of melodies himself, such as "Ein' feste Burg" ("A Mighty Fortress"). Sometimes he used the traditional Gregorian Chant melodies from the Catholic worship and added new German words to it, for example "Christ lag in Todesbanden" ("Christ lay in Death's Dark Bonds").
The words of a chorale have a rhyming pattern. Most of the melodies have an AAB shape (the melody of the first part sung twice, then the second part). This shape is called "Bar form" in German. 
Johann Sebastian Bach used many chorale tunes, usually adding harmony of his own. He used these in his cantatas. Many of these chorales in four-part harmonies are sung as hymns today in German Protestant churches, and some of the tunes are used in English-speaking countries as well.
Chorale tunes also appear in chorale preludes, pieces for the organ. These would usually have been played during the church services before the chorale was sung.
Chorales were used by many later composers in their compositions, e.g. Felix Mendelssohn, Anton Bruckner and Max Reger.

Elizabeth Woodville

Elizabeth Woodville was the wife of King Edward IV of England. She was the mother of King Edward V of England. She was also the mother of Elizabeth of York, the queen consort of King Henry VII of England.
Elizabeth was born some time around the year 1437, at Grafton Regis, Northamptonshire. Her parents were Sir Richard Woodville and his wife, Jacquetta of Luxembourg, a foreign noblewoman who had first been married to the Duke of Bedford. After her first husband died, Jacquetta fell in love with Sir Richard, who was not very rich or important even though he was a knight. Jacquetta's friends and family felt that it was an unsuitable marriage and that he was not good enough for her. They had fourteen children altogether.
When Elizabeth first met Edward, she was a widow. Elizabeth and her first husband, Lord Grey, had two sons, Thomas and Richard. Then Lord Grey was killed in battle, fighting on the opposite side to King Edward. Because she was a widow who already had children, and because her family had supported King Edward's enemies, she was thought to be an unsuitable wife for the king. Elizabeth and Edward were married in secret, because the king did not want to quarrel with his great friend the Earl of Warwick, who wanted Edward to marry a princess. At the time of their marriage, Edward was 22 and Elizabeth a few years older.
When the Earl of Warwick discovered that the young king had married Elizabeth without his permission, he was furious. Although he was forced to accept the marriage, he became angry at the way Elizabeth's family grew powerful as a result of her becoming queen. A few years later, he turned against Edward and tried to put his rival, King Henry VI of England, back on the throne. While Edward was fighting to get his throne back, Elizabeth went to Westminster Abbey to find sanctuary; this meant that, because the abbey was a holy place, she could not be captured by her enemies as long as she remained there. While there, she gave birth to her first son, who was named Edward after his father. After a while, her husband returned and rescued her and her children, defeating the Earl of Warwick in battle and killing him.
Elizabeth and Edward had ten children altogether. Their eldest son, Edward, should have become king when his father died. However, King Edward died suddenly, and his own younger brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, snatched the throne. Richard hated the Woodville family, and killed Elizabeth's brother Anthony, who had been the guardian of her son Edward. Both Edward and Elizabeth's younger son, Richard, were placed in the Tower of London (which was then a royal palace). After a few months, they disappeared, and it was thought that King Richard had killed them. This rumour made the new king unpopular with many of his people, and two years later, Henry Tudor took the throne from him in battle and became King Henry VII of England. Henry VII married Elizabeth's eldest daughter, who was also called Elizabeth. Elizabeth Woodville herself died a few years later at Bermondsey Abbey.

Forth Road Bridge

The Forth Road Bridge is a suspension bridge crossing the Firth of Forth in Scotland. It connects the city of Edinburgh to Fife. The bridge carries cars and pedestrians across the Firth. It was built in 1963. Trains use the nearby Forth Rail Bridge, a historic railroad bridge built in 1890.
Even though the bridge was built so recently, it has had some serious repairs done. A report into the failure of nine heavy-duty nuts on the Forth Road Bridge said all 1,888 similar nuts on the crossing should be replaced.
All the cable band nuts and bolts were replaced in the late 1990s as part of a large project to replace the hanger ropes. Ten years later, a report found serious defects. Bridge authority FETA investigated when inspectors found the nine cracked nuts. Engineers FaberMaunsell carried out lab tests and a study of similar issues on suspension bridges across the world. The nuts are used to secure 192 'cable bands' to the bridge's main cables.
The report also found workmen had not placed washers correctly. This may have led to uneven pressure on the nuts. The protective coating on the nuts was poor, and allowed moisture to cause damage.
Engineers have now replaced all nuts and bolts which were cracked.

Yankee Stadium

Yankee Stadium is the new baseball stadium of the New York Yankees. It is in the New York City borough of the Bronx. The stadium opened in April 2009. It replaced the original Yankee Stadium, which the Yankees had played in since 1923. It was opened with an exhibition game against the Chicago Cubs on April 3, 2009. The first regular game was played on April 16, 2009.
The new stadium cost 1.5 billion dollars to build. It was the most expensive baseball stadium in the world. It is built to look like the old Yankee Stadium. It has many new, and more modern features.
The new stadium has many parts that look similar to the old one when it was first built. This includes the outside walls of the stadium, the color of the seats, and the size of the playing field being the same.
The new stadium has an area known as "Monument Park" behind the center field wall. Monument Park has monuments honoring good Yankee players from past years. Monument Park is open before the game starts.
Another feature is the Great Hall. The Great Hall is a hallway near the entrance of the stadium with a tall roof and many stores and food stands. It also has banners to celebrate the team's history.
The new stadium has more than three times as many suites as the original. A suite is a fancy room with a view of the field where rich people watch the game. There are also many bars and clubs. It has better food than the original stadium.
People can drive to the stadium. There are several garages near it. It is near the New York Thruway in the Bronx. The stadium can also be reached by train, because there is a subway station near it. Trains can often be seen from the stadium.
The stadium is generally seen as being better than its predecessor, but some people dislike it. This mainly because the stadium's high cost has led to very high ticket prices. The high prices meant that there were many empty seats when the stadium first opened, especially behind the batter where tickets can cost up to 2,500 dollars. People have also disliked the stadium for its fan unfriendly practices. For example, fans cannot get autographs from players before the game. The stadium was seen as too expensive for being only a little better than the original. The new stadium also allowed many home runs during its first month, because of the way the wind moves the ball. That made many people call it "too easy".

Citi Field

Citi Field is a major league baseball park outside of New York City in Queens New York, and the home of the New York Mets, since the 2009 MLB season. Citi Field is sponsored by Citi Bank. It broke ground in 2006 when the Mets home was still Shea stadium. The stadium was built as a replacement for Shea Stadium, which was where the parking lot is today. It was torn down after the 2008 baseball season. The 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was played at Citi Field.
Ideas to build a new ball park in Queens were first discussed in the 1990s. This happened because the Met's then current stadium, Shea Stadium, was growing older and did not have many features found in newer stadiums. The Mets, along with the City of New York made plans to build a new stadium, next to Shea. The project to build the stadium was approved in March 2006, and construction started soon after. The building of the stadium could be seen from Shea, during the 2007 and 2008 baseball season. The new stadium, named Citi Field opened on April 13, 2009.
Citi Field has many interesting and unique attractions. The park has seats for up to 41,000 fans to watch a game. The seats are painted green to look similar to the Polo Grounds- another New York stadium torn down in 1965. Citi Field has a home run Apple in center field. The Apple is not a real apple, rather it is a large plastic apple with the Mets sign on it that rises when a Mets player hits a home run. This is similar to Shea stadium, which also had a home run apple. The foul poles at the stadium are painted orange. 
Another part of the stadium is the Jackie Robinson Rotunda. This is the place where most fans enter the stadium, and teaches fans about Jackie Robinson, the first black player in Major League Baseball. Citi Field also has an area called the Pepsi Porch. It is a place where fans can watch the game in the outfield. The first two rows of the porch are over the playing field.
There is also a smaller field behind the centerfield wall where kids can play baseball and other games. The stadium also has a museum to show Mets history and many restaurants, bars, stores, and food stands which surround the field. 
Citi Field has many big parking lots which surround the stadium, allowing fans to bring their car to the game. The Stadium also has a train station with the New York City Subway and Long Island railroad that goes to downtown New York City.
In the years after it opened, the stadium had a few changes. After the 2011 baseball season, the outfield fences were moved closer to the batter, because people thought it was too hard to hit home runs. The fences were also painted blue and orange.

Fakir

A fakir or faqir, is a Sufi who performs feats of endurance or magic. The word comes from "faqr" (), meaning "poverty".
In English, the word is often for Hindu ascetics (e.g., sadhus, gurus, swamis and yogis) as well as Sufi mystics. It can also be used to for a common street beggar who chants holy names, scriptures or verses. It has become a common Urdu and Hindi word for "beggar".
Many stereotypes of the great fakir exist, including a near-naked man easily walking barefoot on burning coals, sitting or sleeping on a bed of sharp nails, floating in the air while meditating, or "living on air" (refusing all food).

<doc id="177079" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177079" title="Alpha particle">
Alpha particle

An alpha particle is made up of two protons and two neutrons. It is a kind of helium, except without electrons. Radioactive elements give out alpha particles when they go through a kind of radioactive decay, known as alpha decay.
During alpha decay, the atomic nucleus releases an alpha particle. The nucleus will lose two protons and two neutrons when this happens. After the decay, the atom will change to another element, because the atom loses two protons. For example, if Americium were to go through alpha decay it would change into Neptunium because Neptunium is defined to have two protons less than Americium. Alpha decay usually happens in heavy elements, those containing more neutrons and protons, such as uranium, thorium, plutonium, and radium.
Alpha particles cannot even go through a few centimetres of air. Alpha irradiation cannot hurt humans when the alpha source is outside the human body, because human skin does not let the alpha particles go through. Alpha radiation can be very harmful if the source is inside the body, such as when people breathe dust or gas containing materials which decay by emitting alpha particles.
For example, there is an element called americium-241 which gives off alpha radiation. This radiation can be very harmful if it is inside someone's body because it can change the DNA in the cells. But it is not harmful when it is outside of the body because alpha radiation does not travel through the outside layers of the skin very well.
When scientists write equations about nuclear reactions they use the Greek letter Alpha.

Greenpeace

Greenpeace is an international non-governmental organisation working for the protection and conservation of the environment. It was set up in Vancouver, Canada in 1971 and now has regional and national offices in 46 countries.
Greenpeace received international attention during the 1980s when the French intelligence agency bombed the Greenpeace ship "Rainbow Warrior" in the Auckland Harbour, killing one individual. In the following years, Greenpeace evolved into one of the largest environmental organizations in the world. Greenpeace is known for its direct actions and has been described as the most visible environmental organization in the world. The organization has raised environmental issues to public knowledge, and influenced both the private and the public sector.
On its official website, Greenpeace defines its mission as the following:
All Greenpeace actions are based on a common set of values and should therefore be: nonviolent, non-partisan, independent and international.
Since Greenpeace was founded, seagoing ships have played a vital role in its campaigns. The group has three ocean-going ships, the Esperanza, Arctic Sunrise and Rainbow Warrior III.
Greenpeace receives its funding exclusively from individual supporters and foundations. Greenpeace screens all major donations in order to ensure it does not receive unwanted donations. The organization does not accept money from governments, political parties or corporations in order to avoid their influence. Donations from foundations which are funded by political parties or receive most of their funding from governments are also rejected.

Seal (device)

A seal is something such as a piece of wax which has an official mark on it, and which is attached to an important letter or document to make it official. It can also mean the device (e.g. a metal stamp or ring) which is used to make the official mark.
The word comes from the Latin “sigillum”.
The study of seals is called Sigillography.
Seals are used on documents to prove that they really did come from the person who signed it (they “authenticate” the document). A seal could be put on the letter itself, or on the envelope where it is stuck down. The writer would pour some wax over the joint of the letter, then press a ring or metal stamp (called a matrix) which has his official mark on. This meant that no one would be able to open the letter and then close it again, because the seal will break when the letter is opened. Most governments still put seals on important documents. Letters do not normally have seals any more, even important letters.
Sometimes lead, pewter or ivory were used instead of wax.
Each seal is different from any other. This means that an important person (e.g. a king) has his own personalized stamp. 
Seals were used in very early civilizations. In ancient Mesopotamia seals were engraved on cylinders, which could be rolled to create an impression on clay. Signet-rings of kings from Ancient Egypt have been found. From Ancient Egypt seals in the form of signet-rings of kings have been found. Other ancient seals come from Saudi Arabia or the Ancient Greek and Roman times. 
After the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 seals were not used so much. The Popes used lead seals, and Charlemagne (who died in 814) had a special seal engraved with Jupiter Sarpis. In England all the kings from Edward the Confessor onwards had their own “seal of majesty”.
Seals from East Asian later developed into block printing. Seals from China have been found from the 5th century B.C.
The wearing of signet rings (from Latin "signum" meaning sign) is an old tradition among nobles in European and some other cultures. In Latin America, it is also traditional for the descendants of the old "criollo" aristocratic families to wear signet rings in the Spanish tradition.
Signet rings were often worn on the little finger of either the right or left hand (depending on the country), although some countries have different customs (French and German noblemen, and some Spanish nobles wear it on the ring finger of their left hand; Swiss wear it on the ring finger of their right hand). In the United Kingdom, signet rings are typically worn on the little finger of the left hand of the bearer and are often cast of gold. The ring is worn with the seal facing outwards so that the wearer can make a seal without taking the ring off.
A similar tradition is found with blacksmiths who use their “touchmark” (a stamp used on the hot metal to show who made it) on whatever they made. When they died their touchmark was destroyed.
The study of seals (sigillography) is very useful in many areas: genealogy, political history, art history etc. This is because modern science can work out very closely how old a seal is. This makes it possible to date documents or works of art.
The word “seal” is often used as a metaphor: 
Because seals are used to close something officially, the word “seal” can also be used in other situations with a similar meaning:

The Attitude Era

The Attitude Era was a period in the World Wrestling Federation and professional wrestling history. It began with the Monday Night Wars and reached its end with the conclusion of the Wars in 2001. The Attitude Era professional, like the 1980s wrestling boom, made wrestling more popular in the United States from the late 1990s to early 2000s. Television ratings and pay-per-view buy-rates reached their highest points. Unlike the more traditional WWF programming, the Attitude Era tried to attract the young adult demographic. It did this by transforming the product into a more controversial "shock value" form of entertainment similar to the "Trash TV" genre popularized in the 1990s.

The Ecdysozoa (also called cycloneuralia) are a group of protostome animal phyla. This is a taxon above the level of phylum. It includes the Arthropoda (insects and crustaceans), Nematoda, and several smaller phyla. 
They were first defined in 1997, based mainly on phylogenetic trees got from 18S ribosomal RNA genes. A large study in 2008 strongly supported the Ecdysozoa as a clade, that is, a group consisting of a common ancestor and all its descendants.
The group is also supported by morphological characters, and includes all animals that shed their exoskeleton (see ecdysis).

Apostasy in Islam

Apostasy in Islam is when a follower of Islam tries to change their religion. When someone tries to reject their religion, this is called apostasy. There are different cases to be handled:
Most Sunni Islam and the Twelvers Shi'a Islamic schools of thought agree that apostasy is a sin. There is a difference between harmful apostasy and harmless apostasy (also known as major and minor apostasy). According to Wael Hallaq nothing of the apostasy law are based on the Qur'an, although the jurist al-Shafi'i interpreted the Qu'ranic verse 2:217. This provided the main evidence for apostasy being a capital crime in Islam. Sharia says the punishment for apostasy should be death, but the Qu'ran does not have a punishment for apostates in this world.
Some Islamic jurists argued or issued fatwas that either the changing of religion is not punishable or is only punishable under restricted circumstances Some groups within Islam, such as the Shi'a Ismaili, reject death for apostasy altogether.

The Rio Hondo (Spanish for "deep river") is a river in Los Angeles County, California. Its official beginning is at a reservoir called the Whittier Narrows Reservoir; and it flows southwest to the Los Angeles River. Notably, the Whittier Narrows Reservoir is also fed by the San Gabriel River, and water can be released into either river. Therefore, the watersheds of the Los Angeles River and San Gabriel River are connected by the Rio Hondo. 
Most of the Rio Hondo is lined with concrete, but there are two places the river is free-flowing. These are the "Peck Road Water Conservation Park" and the "Whittier Narrows Recreation Area". Eaton Wash is a tributary to the Rio Hondo.

Classical conditioning

Classical conditioning (also Pavlovian conditioning) is a form of associative learning. 
Ivan Pavlov was the first to show in what way it works. He did this in 1927, using dogs. There is one stimulus which is called "neutral", and there is another, which has some meaning. If the two stimuli are often presented together, the organism "learns" that they belong together. As a result, it is enough to show the neutral stimulus to get what Pavlov referred this learned relationships to as a "conditional reflex", or to what is today called a conditioned reflex or response.
Pavlov did the experiment with dogs. Each time before he fed the dogs, he rang a bell. The dogs then learned that when the bell rang they would be fed. So they started to salivate, when they heard the bell ring, even before they saw or smelled the food.

Arthur Nikisch

Arthur Nikisch (born Lébény Szent Miklós, Hungary, 12 October 1855; died Leipzig, 23 January 1922) was a Hungarian conductor. He conducted in Germany as well as internationally and was thought of as the greatest conductor of his time.
Arthur Nikisch was born in Hungary (then the Austro-Hungarian Empire). His father was from Moravia, his mother was Hungarian. As a child he showed exceptional musical talent. He learned the piano and the violin and studied at the Vienna Conservatory, where he won prizes for composition and for playing the violin and piano. He was playing the violin in the orchestra when Richard Wagner conducted a concert in Bayreuth to celebrate the beginning of the building of his new theatre: the Bayreuth Festspielhaus. He joined the Vienna Court Orchestra where he played in concerts that were conducted by famous composers such as Brahms, Liszt, Verdi and Wagner. Soon he started his career as conductor in Leipzig. He quickly became internationally famous. In 1889 he was invited to conduct the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He conducted many concerts in the USA. In 1893 he became conductor of the Budapest Opera. Two years later he also became conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, taking the place of Carl Reinecke. In the same year he also became the main conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic. He remained conductor of these two world famous orchestras until his death.
Nikisch gave concerts all over the world, appearing as guest conductor with great orchestras such as the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1912 he took the London Symphony Orchestra to the USA, the first European Orchestra to tour there (fortunately they cancelled their booking on the RMS Titanic at the last moment). He conducted at the Leipzig Opera and taught conducting at the Leipzig Conservatory.
Nikisch was famous for his conducting of the great Romantic composers such as Schumann, Brahms, Bruckner, Tchaikovsky and Wagner as well as Beethoven. He had a great influence on the next generation of conductors including Wilhelm Furtwängler and Sir Adrian Boult. He helped composers such as Mahler, Max Reger and Richard Strauss to become famous by performing their music.
Nikisch married the singer Amélie Heusner. Their son Mitja became a successful pianist.

Energy conservation is the act of using energy in a more efficient and effective manner. While any form of energy may be conserved, electricity is the type most commonly referred to in connection with conservation. 
Conserving electricity can involve many different activities, from replacing an inefficient appliance to turning off a light. Successful conservation involves both technological and behavioral measures. 
Energy conservation is an important complement to the development of renewable energy sources. Both energy conservation and renewable energy are important aspects of sustainability.

Billups Neon Crossing Signal

The Billups Neon Crossing Signal was a special signal to warn car and truck drivers that a train was coming. It was placed at a dangerous Illinois Central railroad crossing on Mississippi State Route 7 in Grenada, Mississippi.
It was put up in the mid-1930s by inventor Alonzo Billups. Mr. Billups and the railroad were worried; the crossing had many accidents between trains and motor vehicles. He wanted drivers who were going to cross the tracks to know that a train was coming and he wanted to do it in a very big way. The Billups signal was built like a giant steel gantry which went up and over the entire highway. This is similar to crossing signals used today in North America; Mr. Billups' signal may have been the very first time such a signal was built. A pair of flashing red lights similar to those used today topped giant neon signs on either side of the big gantry. The signs lit up with the words "Stop-DEATH-Stop" along with a neon skull and crossbones. Flashing neon arrows pointed toward the train to tell drivers which way the train was coming. The Billups Neon Crossing Signal even had a special way of warning drivers with sound. Instead of the electric or electronic bells used now, this signal used a very loud air raid siren.
After World War II started, neon became hard to get. The signal had electrical problems as well. Often, the air raid siren would go off even if no train was coming and it wouldn't shut off until the railroad sent a repair crew. No more of these special signals were ever built and the only one ever built was taken down after less than twenty years.

The New Age, also called the New Age movement is a kind of spiritual belief and way of life held by some westerners. It is not an organized religion. They believe in religious pluralism- that people are free to decide what they believe and how they use it in their lives. They pick and mix what they believe with bits taken from both eastern and western culture and religions. They make their own decisions about what God is and how they worship God. New Age people often meditate to seek their own contact with God.
There are many authors who describe how they see the New Age in books. There is also New Age music which tends to be calm and relaxing.
New Age people do all believe that a new future time is coming in which people will be more aware of their own special spiritual nature and this will make the world a different and better place.

Otto Klemperer

Otto Klemperer (born Breslau, 14 May 1885; died Zürich, 6 July 1973 was a German-born conductor and composer. He is thought of as one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century.
Klemperer was born in Breslau, Silesia, which was then in Germany, but is now called Wrocław in Poland. He was born into a Jewish family. He studied music at the Conservatory in Frankfurt am Main, and then went to Berlin where he studied conducting and composition with Hans Pfitzner. In 1905 he met Gustav Mahler who was very impressed with him. He recommended him for the job of conductor at the German Opera in Prague. He soon got jobs in other places: Hamburg, Barmen, Strasbourg, Cologne and Wiesbaden. He was offered a job at the Berlin Staatsoper, but he did not want it because he thought he would not be able to do things there the way he wanted. However, four years later, in 1927, he took a job with a special branch of the Staatsoper which had been started in order to perform new music in modern (non-traditional) performances. They played in the Kroll Theatre. Klemperer became very famous for the performances that he conducted there.
The Kroll Theatre had been started by politicians who supported the Weimar Republic. They wanted opera to be different from the traditional operas that were performed in the Theatre Unter den Linden supported by the monarchy. 
The operas that Klemperer conducted there included Leoš Janáček's "From the House of the Dead", Arnold Schönberg's "Erwartung", Igor Stravinsky's "Oedipus Rex", and Paul Hindemith's "Cardillac".
By 1931 the political situation had changed and the Kroll Opera was shut down. By 1933 the Nazis had gained power and Klemperer left Germany and went to the United States where he took U.S. nationality. He became conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra (1933-39) and also conducted the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Pittsburg Orchestra. However he was not happy in the United States where the musical culture and music critics were largely out of sympathy with his Weimar modernism and he felt he was not properly valued. He hoped for a permanent position as lead conductor in New York or Philadelphia. But in 1936 he was passed over in both - first in Philadelphia, where Eugene Ormandy succeeded Stokowski at the Philadelphia Orchestra, and then in New York, where Toscanini's departure left a vacancy at the New York Philharmonic but John Barbirolli and Artur Rodzinski were engaged in preference to Klemperer. The New York decision was particularly galling, as Klemperer had been engaged to conduct the first fourteen weeks of the New York Philharmonic's 1935-6 season. Klemperer's bitterness at this decision was voiced in a letter he wrote to Arthur Judson, who ran the orchestra: "that the society did not reengage me is the strongest offense, the sharpest insult to me as artist, which I can imagine. You see, I am no youngster. I have a name and a good name. One could not use me in a most difficult season and then expell me. This non-reengagement will have very bad results not only for me in New York but in the whole world... This non-reengagement is an absolutely unjustified wrong done to me by the Philharmonic Society."
In 1939 he had a series illness and was operated on for a brain tumour. For some time he was not well enough to work. Then from 1947 to 1950 he returned to Europe to conduct the Budapest Opera. In the early 1950s Klemperer experienced difficulties arising from his U.S. citizenship. American union policies made it difficult for him to record in Europe, while his left wing views made him increasingly unpopular with the State Department and FBI. In 1952 the United States refused to renew his passport. 
In 1954 Klemperer again returned to Europe, becoming conductor of the Philharmonia Orchestra in London. He took German nationality. By this time Furtwängler was dead and Toscanini had retired, so Klemperer was thought of as the greatest conductor of German music. He was given a recording contract by EMI. His concerts and many recordings with the Philharmonia brought him world-wide recognition. He lived in Switzerland but spent much time in London conducting.
Klemperer became an Israeli citizen in 1970. He retired from conducting in 1971 and died in Zürich in 1973, aged 88. 
Klemperer’s performances that we have on record show us that he was a musician who understood the shape of a musical work perfectly. He often chose slow speeds, but the music could sound very heroic. His health problems included manic depression which made him sometimes very difficult to work with. He also had a bad fall in Montreal. From then onwards he always had to sit down to conduct. He also burnt himself badly because he was smoking in bed, and he tried to put out the flames with a glass of whisky which made the fire worse. 
Klemperer is less well known as a composer, but he wrote a number of works, although he hardly ever performed them and most of them are now forgotten.

Aum Shinrikyo

Aum Shinrikyo is a Japanese cult movement which carried out a terrorist attack on a Tokyo subway in 1995. Although it claims to be a new religious movement, several governments regard it as a terrorist movement.
Aum members used a poisonous gas called Sarin for their attack. In five attacks, they released sarin on several lines of the Tokyo subway. This killed thirteen people, and severely injuring fifty. It caused temporary vision problems for nearly a thousand others. 
After the event, the movement renamed itself to "Aleph". Aum Shinrikyo has been formally designated a terrorist organization by several entities, including Canada, and the United States. 
On 10 October 1995, Aum Shinrikyo was ordered to be stripped of its official status as a "religious legal entity" and was declared bankrupt in early 1996. However the group continues to operate under the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion. It is funded by a successful computer business and donations, and is kept under strict surveillance. Attempts to ban the group altogether under the 1952 Subversive Activities Prevention Law were rejected by the Public Security Examination Commission in January 1997.
In April 2011 the Public Security Intelligence Agency stated that Aum currently had about 1,500 members. At the end of July 2011 the cult reported its membership as 1,030. The group was reportedly active in trying to recruit new members among Japan's youth via social media websites and proselytizing on college campuses.

<doc id="177591" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177591" title="Woodstock, Ontario">
Woodstock, Ontario

Woodstock is a city and the county seat of Oxford County, Ontario in southwestern Ontario, Canada. Woodstock is 128 km southwest of Toronto, north of Highway 401 (Ontario) along the historic Thames River (Ontario). It is known as the Dairy Capital of Canada and promotes itself as "The Friendly City." In 2006, 35,480 people lived in Woodstock.
The community was first settled in 1800 after it was determined by Sir John Graves Simcoe, governor of what was then known as Upper Canada, that the area would make a good townsite. The early settlers were American immigrants from New York state. Increased immigration from Great Britain followed in the 1820s and 1830s. Woodstock was incorporated as a town in 1851 and a city in 1901.
Vansittart Avenue (named after Admiral Henry Vansittart, an early settler) in Woodstock's west end has one of the finest residential Victorian streetscapes in the province. Woodstock has a community center that hosts hockey games in addition to many social gatherings.
The city government, Woodstock City Council, consists of four city councillors and two city and county councillors. Trevor Birtch is the current mayor, following a hard fought and demanding campaign. Oxford Centre is the district in which Woodstock is included when voting in federal elections. Currently, the MP of Oxford is Dave MacKenzie (of the Conservative party).
On August 7, 1979, the Woodstock area was hit by three tornadoes, two of which registered at least F4 on the Fujita Scale. On the west side of town along Ingersoll Road, a Dominion Food Store was heavily damaged while the tornadoes skipped over every other home and business. Dickson's Florist was wiped out and the Fry home was moved on its foundation. Father Grondziel of the new Polish Roman Catholic Church, next to the Dominion Food Store, had just stepped into the washroom when one of the tornadoes passed by and took off the roof of the church and everything in the room he had just been in. No one on the street was injured and the cleanup took many weeks. On the south side, the buildings of the Maranatha Christian Reformed Church and the John Knox Christian School were destroyed, and the only fatality occurred when a vehicle on Highway 401 was blown off the road and the lone occupant killed.
One of Woodstock's most notable historic sites is Old St. Paul's Church, the mother church of the Anglican Communion in Oxford County. The church was built in 1834. It is near the intersection of Huron and Dundas Streets. It used as a temporary jail during the rebellion of 1837. The church is a beautiful, brick cruciform structure surrounded by Woodstock's oldest cemetery. It has original box pews and dozens of memorial tablets commemorating prominent Woodstock citizens.
The "Springbank Snow Countess" was commemorated by a life-size statue (designed by acclaimed Oxford County agricultural artist Ross Butler) which is on the corner of Dundas and Springbank.
This bell iron and lead statue was made to honour a record-setting milk production by a Holstein (Friesian) cow named Snow Countess.
The statue was first unveiled on August 4, 1937 by the Holstein Frisian Association of Canada. Snow Countess was born on November 18, 1919 and died at age 16 on August 9, 1936. During her lifetime, she produced 9,062 pounds of butterfat, impressive at the time. The statue and granite base cost $4,000 to design and erect.
The cow has become an important symbol to Woodstock and is used in many cultural events, such as the annual Cowapalooza Festival.
Construction was started on the dam in 1964 and officially completed in 1967. The cost of the dam and land base at that time was close to $6 million. Present annual maintenance costs are about $40,000.
The Pittock Dam is designed for both flood control and flow augmentation purposes. It is designed to benefit water quality downstream during dry summer conditions and provide year round flood control capability to protect downstream communities.
The Woodstock Airport is 2.5 nautical miles (4.6 km) west of Woodstock.
In June 2005, Toyota, the world's second largest automaker, announced plans to build a new, $800 million automobile assembly plant in Woodstock on a 1,000-acre (4 km²) undeveloped site in the city's northeast end. The plant was expected to employ 2000 people and begin full production of the Toyota RAV4 SUV in November 2008, at the rate of 150,000 a year. However, due to the recent economic problems and the slowing car sales, Toyota announced that production would be cut by 50% to 75,000 a year and the work force shrunk 40% to 1200 people. Fortunately the other 800 workers are expected to be recalled when car sales increase. It was the first new auto assembly plant to be built in Canada in two decades.
Late in 2008, the plant began producing vehicles, and on December 4, a ceremony attended by Ontario and federal government representatives as well as top Toyota executives, took place to celebrate its official opening.
Early in March 2006, Hino Motors, a Toyota Motor Co. subsidiary, announced that it will be the first Japanese truck manufacturer to build its vehicles in Canada with a new Woodstock plant slated to begin production in April 2006, in the former General Seating plant in the Pattullo Ridge Business Park near Highway 401 and Highway 59.
The $3 million, 120,000 square foot (11,000 m²) plant will employ 45 and assemble 2,000 trucks a year when it begins production.
In late November 2008 the Hino Motors automotive plant was completed.
Other Major Industries in Woodstock include:
Vuteq Canada Inc (automotive parts supplier)
Firestone Textiles
CBM (Concrete)
Toyota Boshuko
General Motors (national parts distribution center)
RWF Braun (Heavy Equipment)
Standard Tube
A major Canadian piano and organ and reed organ company operated under the name of Woodstock Organ Company for many years of the early twentieth century. It was owned by D W Karn, who was at one time mayor of Woodstock. Karn had previously operated an organ and piano manufacturing company under his own name.
Woodstock has one daily newspaper owned by Sun Media Corporation, the "Woodstock Sentinel-Review".
There are three licensed FM radio stations: 
The city also has a rebroadcaster of Toronto television station Citytv, operating on channel 31 and primarily targeting London and surrounding towns.
Intercity transportation includes a VIA Rail train station and a Greyhound Lines of Canada intercity bus depot.
Local public transit service is available daily except Sunday on six routes. No service is provided after 18:30.
Provincial Highway 401 is at the south and east edges of the city, with the junction of Highway 403 east of the urban area. Many Oxford County highways and other roads radiate from Woodstock.

North Magnetic Pole

The North Magnetic Pole is one of two places on the Earth where its magnetic field points vertically downwards. The other is the South Magnetic Pole.
At any other place on earth, the magnetic field points to the North Magnetic Pole. This is why a compass works to find where north is.
The North Magnetic Pole is not identical to the North Pole, which is the geographic north pole. It wanders slowly. In 2001, a team of scientists estimated that the North Magnetic Pole is near Ellesmere Island in northern Canada at . It was estimated to be at in 2005. As of 2015, the pole is thought to have moved east beyond the Canadian Arctic territorial claim to .
Because the North Magnetic Pole is different from the North Pole, a compass does not always point straight north. But usually the difference is small.
Because the Earth's magnetic field is not symmetrical, the South Magnetic Pole is not directly opposite. A line drawn from one to the other does not pass through the centre of the Earth.

Government Communications Headquarters

The Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) is a British intelligence agency. Its work continues that of the Bletchley Park team. 
GCHQ collects, analyses and passes on signals from many parts of the world. This is called "signals intelligence" (SIGINT). It would include all forms of free-to-air signals plus many interceptions of covert communication. Computers scan the signals for key words of phrases, and flag any which contain key words.
The second job of GCHQ is to crack the cyphers (codes) of sources it is interested in. It is this part of the work which Bletchley Park used to do. It also arranges for our own secret transmissions to be coded securely. This is the world of cryptography, ways and means of getting into other people's secrets, and keeping our secrets secure. This is done by CESG (Communications-Electronics Security Group). 
As an organisation, GCHQ is under the guidance of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC). GCHQ was started after the First World War as the Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS or GC&CS), by which name it was known until 1946. As part of ECHELON, it works with Intelligence agencies from other allied countries.

Canadian Forces

The Canadian Forces (CF) (French: Forces canadiennes; FC), is the army, air force, and navy of Canada, commanded by a single structure, unlike the United States. 
Under the National Defence Act, "The Canadian Forces are the armed forces of Her Majesty raised by Canada and consist of one Service called the Canadian Armed Forces." The Commander in Chief of the Canadian Forces is the Head of State of Canada, Queen Elizabeth II, represented by the Governor General of Canada, David Lloyd Johnston. The Chief of the Defence Staff (or CDS), the senior professional member of the service, is General Thomas J. Lawson. The CDS answers to a politician, the Minister of National Defence, who is currently Robert Nicholson of the Conservative Party. 
The Canadian Forces is composed of 67,000 personnel (soldiers, sailors, and airmen/airwomen). Every unit accepts male and female soldiers, if they qualify for the position. The CF is divided in seven main branches, which are called "commands". 
The Environmental branches (called Commands) are mainly administrative structures. They manage the personnel, the equipment and the facilities, but not the operations. There are three commands in the Canadian Forces, because there are no Marines. All the commands work very closely with each other, for example, the Air Force provides helicopters to both the Navy and the Army. These commands also each have a reserve element, made of part-time employees.
This is the army of Canada and the largest branch of the CF. It uses tanks and other armoured vehicles, such as the LAV III, as well as artillery, engineering vehicles, and a variety of weapons, such as the Colt Canada C7 rifle.
This is the navy of Canada. It has 33 active warships including submarines, frigates and destroyers. 
AIRCOM is the air force of Canada. It operates a variety of helicopters and airplanes to support the army and the navy, and also has CF-18 fighters.
The Operational commands are responsible for specific types of operations or for conducting exercises or deployments. There are four operational commands.
The CANSOFCOM is responsible for providing special forces and asymmetric warfare capabilities to Canada. It is the smallest command of the Canadian Forces, and is composed of four joint units that do not answer to either the Army, Navy or Air Force. These units are the Joint Task Force 2, the Canadian Special Operations Regiment, the 427th Special Aviation Squadron and the Canadian Joint Incident Response Unit (CBRN).
This is the command responsible for managing foreign operations and deployments outside of Canada, such as Canada's contribution to the War in Afghanistan. 
Canada Command works with the United States Northern Command to ensure national security and the defence of the North American continent. CANCOM also is responsible for emergency management, such as when the Army is needed to respond to disasters in Canada.
This command is responsible for supporting all the other commands with things such as logistics, engineering, health services, and the military police.
From the second half of the 20th century, the defence policy of Canada is made of these objectives : 
During the Cold War, a major focus of the Canadian Forces was helping with the defence of Europe against the threat posed by the Soviet Union. Some Canadian soldiers lived in Europe during that time.
Today, the Canadian Forces goals are based on the Canada First Defence Strategy, introduced by the conservative government of Stephen Harper. The new goals and objectives are being able to do the following :

Runes

Runes are very old letters which Germanic people used before they started using Latin letters in the Middle Ages. In its broadest sense, the word "runes" can mean any cryptic letters, but it usually means the alphabets used by Scandinavian people from about the year 150 CE to the Middle Ages. The oldest of these is called the "Elder Fuþark", used from about 150 to 800 CE. Around the year 800 the runes changed into the "Younger Fuþark", and these were used until about 1100, when the Latin alphabet replaced them. The Anglo-Saxon runes were used about the same time (400-1100) in Britain. The Scandinavian runes are called "Fuþark" because the first six letters in the runic alphabet are ᚠ ᚢ ᚦ ᚨ ᚱ ᚲ (F U Þ A R K). The Anglo-Saxon runes are called "Fuþorc" because they are a little different.
Runes are found carved into stones (called runestones) in many places in Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway and Sweden), and in the British Isles, Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Frisia. Runes have been used for writing poems and eulogies, and they are still sometimes used to write ciphers. Runes were also used by J. R. R. Tolkien in his fantasy works, which were based on Germanic mythology. Because of their association with Germanic mythology, runes were also used by the Nazis to support a new mysticism and a romantic sense of Germanic heritage. The rune ᚦ survived into the Middle Ages in the English language and to modern times in Icelandic as the letter þ (pronounced "th" as in "thing"). After the Norman conquest, this letter was replaced by the letters "th" because it was unknown to the French-speaking Normans. Similarly, the letter ð (pronounced "th" as in "this") was used in Old English and is still used in Icelandic, but it is from Irish, not from the runes.
When the runes were first used, the Germanic languages were not yet split into their modern branches; there was only one unified language (called "Proto-Germanic") with many regional dialects. Each rune had a name, like our modern letters have names, but these very old names are no longer known. By their association with later letters, the old names of the runes have been reconstructed. The [*] before a rune's Proto-Germanic name means this is a reconstructed name. Not all runes were drawn the same way, however, and some of the runes and their names were different in some places.

Janko Prunk

Janko Prunk (), (born December 30, 1942) is a Slovenian historian of modern history. He has published articles and monographs on analytical politology, modern history, the genesis of modern political formations, and the history of social and political philosophy in Slovenia. He has also written on the history of political movements in Slovenia from the end of the 19th century until World War II, especially about Slovene Christian socialism and the history of Slovenian national questions.
Prunk was born in the small village of Loka pri Zidanem Mostu near the town of Sevnica in central Slovenia, in what was then the German-occupied Lower Styria. He graduated from University of Ljubljana in 1966 and obtained his master's degree from the same institution in 1972. He obtained his PhD in 1976 with thesis on the relationship between the Slovenian Christian Socialist movement and the Communist Party of Slovenia within the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People, which at the time was a somehow problematic topic. In 1984 and 1988, he was awarded the scholarships by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, which enabled him to continue his studies in Cologne and Freiburg. Later, he worked as a researcher at the University of Freiburg. From 1966 to 1995, he collaborated with the Institute for modern history in Ljubljana. He worked as professor at the Faculty for Social Sciences of the University of Ljubljana.
He has written on politology, modern history, modern political formations, and the history of social and political thought in Slovenia. He has also written on the history of political movements in Slovenia from the end of 19th century until World War II, especially with Slovene Christian socialism and the history of Slovenian national questions.
Prunk is a member of Leibniz Institute of European History in Mainz, and a senior member of the Center for European Integration Studies in Bonn.
Prunk has been actively involved in politics. As an early admirer of Jože Pučnik, he joined the Slovenian Social Democratic Union after the democratization of Slovenia. He was an active member of the Slovenian Democratic Party (known as Slovenian Social Democratic Party between 1989 and 2003). Between 1992 and 1993, he served as Minister for Slovenes outside Slovenia in the first coalition cabinet of Janez Drnovšek. Between 2004 and 2008, he served as chairman of the Party's internal Committee for Education Policies; he quit for disagreements over the Government policy favouring private universities. He became very critical of the then prime minister Janez Janša, whom he accused of being a "liberal with an authoritative touch" who aspires at becoming a "Slovenian Piłsudski".
From 1992 to 1993, he was the Minister without portfolio for Slovenes abroad in Slovenia in the centre-left government of Janez Drnovšek. In 2005, he was appointed by the Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel as president of the Slovene-Croatian Historical Commission, formed by the governments of the two countries to shed light on the history of the relations between the two nations.
Prunk has written over 500 specialized articles and books. His book "A brief history of Slovenia: Historical background of the Republic of Slovenia" is one of the basic full works on modern Slovenian history.

Mojibake

When problems like these appear, the reason is that when transferring text on the internet, it is actually sent as numbers (bytes). For example, "A" is sent as 65. There are not enough numbers to handle all letters in all languages when using bytes. Only the numbers 0-255 are usually available. Therefore every language has its own interpretation of these numbers. Often the computers misunderstand what the meaning of a number (a byte) is.
Mojibake is a Japanese word. The word 文字化け () is composed of two parts. 文字 ("moji") means "letter", "character". 化け ("bake"), from the verb 化ける ("bakeru"), means "to appear in disguise, to take the form of, to change for the worse". Literally, it means "character mutation".

Visual cortex

The visual cortex is a part of the brain that allows vision. It is relatively thin – between 1.5mm and 2mm in humans. In monkeys and apes the visual cortex take up much of their brain. Physically, the visual cortex is at the back of the brain in the occipital lobe.
David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel did research on the visual cortex for many years. They won the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries about information processing in the visual system. 
Research on the primary visual cortex can involve recording action potentials from electrodes within the brain of cats, ferrets, rats, mice, or monkeys. Alternatively, signals can be recorded outside the animal by EEG, MEG, or fMRI. These techniques gather information without invading the brain.
The primary visual cortex (V1) is the best studied visual area in the brain. This is where the messages arrive from the lateral geniculate nuclei, which are relay stations for information from the retina. Each lateral geniculate nucleus gets signals from the "opposite" visual field.
Each V1 sends information to two primary pathways, called the ventral stream and the dorsal stream.

Driver's license

A driver's license, driver license, driver licence, or driving licence is an official document which states that a person may drive a motorized vehicle, such as a motorcycle, car, truck, or a bus.
Different countries have different laws as to whether or not a person can have a driver's license. In some places, a person must pass a driving test before he or she is given a driver's license, while in other places, a driving license is given before the person starts driving.
In Victoria, Australia (for example), to get a driving licence a person must:
There are fees to be paid to do the driving tests, and if successful, there are more fees to be paid for the licence. Many people get a Learner's permit before getting a license. The first licence may be a Probationary Licence, which has certain restrictions on what a driver can do. After four years, the driver will qualify for a full, unrestricted licence.

Acryl

Acryl is a name for a number of chemical compounds that have an acrylic group, or of polymers of these compounds. Especially esters of acrylic acid are used to help make certain dyes and paints or as adhesives.
In organic chemistry, the acryloyl group is the functional group with structure HC=CH–C(=O)–; it is the acyl group derived from acrylic acid. The preferred IUPAC name for the group is prop-2-enoyl. It is also (less correctly) known as acrylyl or simply acryl. Compounds containing an acryloyl group can be referred to as "acrylic compounds".
An acrylic compound is typically an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound: it contains a carbon–carbon double bond and a carbon–oxygen double bond, separated by a carbon–carbon single bond. It has therefore the properties characteristic for both functional groups : 
In addition, since both double bonds are separated by a single C–C bond, the double bonds are conjugated.

Chuang Tzu

Chuang Tzu or Zhuangzi lived and taught around 350 BC. He was a Taoist philosopher. A collection of his sayings have been passed down over the centuries, and is one of the fundamental sources for Zen Buddhism.
Chang Tzu thought that men should distance themselves from the traditional prestige and honor of worldly life. They should just live. He told a story about two ministers who ask him to serve as a court official. He replied with a story about a sacred turtle. He says, "The king's men caught a sacred turtle. They killed it and put its shell in a special box to use to tell the future. Now would that turtle rather be honored in that box and dead, or would he rather be alive dragging his tail through the mud?"
