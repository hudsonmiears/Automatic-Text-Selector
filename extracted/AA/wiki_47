Barrow, Alaska

Barrow is a city in Alaska. It is the northernmost city of the United States of America. It is the administrative capital of the North Slope Borough.
Barrow is well known because of its unusual location in the United States. It is located on the north coast of Alaska along the Arctic Ocean. There are about 2,100 kilometers between Barrow and the North Pole.
Because Barrow is located above the Arctic Circle, there are times of the year during which the sun never sets, and other times when it never rises above the horizon. Instead of dipping below the horizon every day, during the summer the sun circles around the sky above the horizon. The sun sets on November 18 or 19, and remains below the horizon for about 65 days — that is, until the end of January. In the middle of this polar night (December 21-22), the sky is completely dark all the time, except for about 3 hours of twilight.
The climate is very cold in Barrow. Temperatures are below freezing from early October until late May. The high temperature is above freezing for only about 120 days per year, and there are temperatures at or below on an average of 160 days per year. Freezing temperatures, and snowfall, can occur at any time during the year.
Although Barrow is in the land of the North American continent, Barrow is isolated from any other city. There is no road connecting Barrow and other places in Alaska. Travelers must take airplanes or ships to get there.

Kaltag is a town in Alaska. Kaltag is on the west bank of the Yukon River, 120 km (75 miles) west of Galena. In 2002, there were 230 people living in Kaltag. Most of the people who live in Kaltag are native Americans.
The first people to live in the area were the Koyokon people, part of the Athabascan nation. They used Kaltag as a cemetery for surrounding villages. It is on an old walking track which led west through the mountains to Unalakleet. The Athabascans had many camps in the area. They moved as the animals they hunted for food moved to different areas. There were 12 summer fish camps on the Yukon River between the Koyukuk River and the Nowitna River.
The Russians named Kaltag after a Koyokon man named Kaltaga.
In 1839 smallpox killed many of the people who lived in the area.
When the United States took over Alaska, the army built a telegraph line along the north side of the Yukon River. A trading post opened around 1880. There was a gold rush in 1884-85. Steamboats travelled along the river carrying supplies for the gold miners. In 1900 there were 46 steamboats on the river. Measles and food shortages during 1900 reduced the population of the area by one-third. The village of Kaltag began after this when the people who were left in three nearby villages moved to the area. 
By 1906, most of the people looking gold had left for Fairbanks or Nome. The Galena lead mines opened 1919. Kaltag was down the river from the mines and grew as a point on the transportation route for the mines. It declined in the 1940s as mining declined.
The old cemetery was washed into the river around 1937. An airport and medical clinic were built during the 1960s.
Kaltag has a week long Stick Dance Festival every two years that draws visitors from many other villages. This festival is held by relatives of people who have died, to thank those who helped during their time of mourning.
Most of the people in Kaltag live by hunting and fishing. Salmon, whitefish, moose, bear, waterfowl and berries are the main foods.

Pont-de-Veyle

Pont-de-Veyle is a commune. It is found in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in the Ain department in the east of France. It is 10 kilometers east of Macon, and about 400 km from Paris. In 1999, there were 1571 people living in the commune. It is built on an island made where the River Veyle separates into two branches. The Veyle then flows into the River Saône, which was made the border between the Kingdom of France and the German Empire in 843 by the Treaty of Verdun.
Pont-de-Veyle was first started by the Lords of Bage, and legally made a city by the Counts of Savoy in 1275. It only became French in 1601 under King Henri IV of France as part of the Treaty of Lyon.
Because it was close to the border, this city had to build a castle to defend themselves against the Lords of Macon, the Sires of Beaujeu and the Princes of Dombes. The castle had 14 towers, but today only one remains, the Clock Tower and a doorway from the 14th century, joined by brick walls. Today there is very little left of these walls. The castle was surrounded by a moat filled with water. From 1750 to 1800, they pulled down the city walls and towers that had become dangerous and were about to fall down.
There are many old and historic buildings from the Renaissance and later centuries. The "Savoy" or "House of Lords", whose facade was restored, is one of the most beautiful in the region. There is a priory of Saint Benedict with its Gothic doors. There are many half-timbered houses, such as "The House of the Watchman", which was redeveloped with great care and taste. There are also many spiral staircases of stone, including one at City Hall which was part of the former College of the Jesuits. The Jesuit style church was built in 1755. The hospital which was started in 1322, still has 18th century buildings.
After the Reformation and the religious wars there was a large group of Protestants living in the city. When the Edict of Nantes, a law which gave them religious freedom, was overturned, they fled the city and went to live in Switzerland and Germany.
Jean-Louis Carra, a French journalist and revolutionary, was born in Pont-de-Veyle on 9 March 1742. He was executed by the guillotine in Paris on 31 October, 1793.

Piggott is a city of the state of Arkansas in the United States of America. In 2000 there were about 3,900 people living in Piggott which is the largest city in Clay County. The town was first called Huston, but was later named Piggott after Dr. James Piggott, an early resident.

American author Ernest Hemingway visited Piggot many times during the 1930s. His second wife's parents, Paul and Mary Pfeiffer, lived in Piggott. They converted a barn into a studio where Hemingway could write. He wrote a lot of his novel "A Farewell to Arms" in the studio. The house and barn are now the Hemingway-Pfeiffer Museum and Educational Center which is run by Arkansas State University.

Skateboarding

Skateboarding is the act of riding on a skateboard. A person who skateboards is most often called a "skateboarder". 
Skateboarding can be a hobby, an art, a job, or a way of moving around. Skateboarding has been changed by many skateboarders over many years. A 2002 report by "American Sports Data" found that there were 18.5 million skateboarders in the world. Of those skateboarders, 85 percent were under 18 years old, and 74 percent were male.
Skateboarding started when surfers in California wanted to take surfing to the street. Soon, the first skateboard was invented in the 1950s. From there, the new culture of skateboarding was created.
The basic tricks of skateboarding are ollies, kickflips, shuv-its, and 180s ("one-eighties"). These are the tricks that new skateboarders often try. An "ollie" is when someone pops the board and gets off the ground. A kickflip is done by doing an ollie and rotating the board. A "shuv-it" is done by turning the board 180° while staying above the board. A "180" is done by turning the board 180°, along with the skateboarder. There are also variations of these tricks, such as the "tre flip", which is a 360° shuv-it and a kickflip.

Leedsichthys

Leedsichthys problematicus, ('Leeds fish') was a giant fossil fish of the Jurassic period. It was a pachycormid, a group of extinct ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii). "Leedsichthys" is the largest fish known, with an estimated length of up to 16 metres. The Blue Whale is twice as long, at 30 metres, but that is a mammal, not a fish.
Leedsichthys fossils are incomplete, making it impossible to know the exact length. The fossil is named after its discoverer, Alfred Nicholson Leeds, who discovered it before 1886 near Peterborough, England.
Like the worlds biggest fish today, the Whale shark, the "Leedsichthys problematicus" was a filter feeder, getting its nutrition from plankton. Remains of over 70 individuals have now been found.

Oddworld

Oddworld is a name given to a video game series that has won many awards. It was created by Oddworld Inhabitants and was founded by Lorne Lanning and Sherry McKenna. The name is for both the series and the fictional universe where the games in the series take place. The first game in the series, "" was first sold in 1997 and was the first game for the Oddworld Quintology. Between 1997 and 2005, a total of four different games have been sold and from 2010-2012 Munch's Oddysee and Stranger's Wrath games were made for PC and made in HD for the Playstation 3. The games have also been developed by several developers. GT Interactive developed Abe's Oddysee and Abe's Exoddus, Microsoft Gaming Studios developed Munch's Oddysee, EA Games developed Stranger's Wrath, and Just Add Water (Developments LTD) have developed Stranger's Wrath HD, Munch's Oddysee HD, and Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty. The games themselves were set in the part of Oddworld called Mudos.
"Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee" was the first game in the series and the Quintology. It is a 2D flip-scrolling platform game. It was first sold in September 1997 for the PlayStation video game console and Microsoft Windows. In the game, the player plays as Abe who works in a meat processing plant called RuptureFarms. The game flips through different screens. Some screens have creatures from the Oddworld universe which are programmed to kill Abe. Each Abe game has a feature called GameSpeak where Abe can speak to his fellow Mudokons and take control of the Slig. This is done by chanting. Once the Slig is possessed, he can do what he could do whilst he was not possessed but he can shoot other Sligs and Slogs and unlock doors and electric walls The goal of the game is to save Abe's friends who are known as "Mudokons". There are 99 Mudokons in the game. Some of them are hidden in secret areas and when Abe lands in a secret area, the game will give the player an audio cue. The game has two different ways it ends. If, at the end of the game, the player does not save at least 50 native Mudokons, the bad ending will appear instead of the good ending. The game was re-released as Classics on PC in 2008 on Steam and then on PS3 on Playstation Network in 2009. A Gameboy version called Oddworld: Adventures was released in 1998 by Saffire Corporation and it was a shorter version of Abe's Oddysee.
Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus was the second game in the series . It was released in November 1998 for the PlayStation video game console and Microsoft Windows and was released as a bonus title. The game play is the same as Abe's Oddysee but with different levels and secret areas. It also has a better GameSpeak than the other game and Abe can have more than one Mudokons following by saying "All o'ya!" and Scrabs, Paramites and Glukons can be possessed. There are 300 Mudokons and the Mudokons have different emotions. They could become angry, depressed or sick, There are new Oddworld creatures as well as different versions of creatures from the first game, for example flying and crawling "Sligs". The game was re-released as Classics in 2008 for PC on Steam and re-released on Playstation Network for the PS3 in 2009. A Gameboy Color version was released in November 1999 by Saffire Corporation. This was a shortened version of the entire game.
Oddworld Munch's Oddysee was the second game to be part of the Quintology. When it was released in 2001, it was only for Xbox and can be played with Munch or Abe and the storyline continued after what happened in Abe's Exoddus. Munch was a new playable character and he was a Gabbit. There were more things to rescue in this game. Abe has to rescue his Native Mudokons. Munch has to rescue fuzzles and labour eggs The endings in the game were based on the Quarma. If the player had a good Quarma, the good ending movie will be played. If the player has a bad quarma, the bad ending movie will be played. A Game Boy Advance version was also released. The original PC port was released in 2010. The game was re-released on PS3 in high definition by Just Add Water in 2012 and was re-released on the PC by Square One Games with a new port in 2016 and was released on the Mac App Store in 2015. 
Oddworld: Strangers Wrath was a game developed by EA games in 2005 that was set in the western side of Mudos. The game was all about a bounty hunter called Stranger. It was a third-person and first person platformer. It was released for the PS3 in HD in 2011 by Just Add Water and was ported to PC by Just Add Water in 2010 followed by a mobile port in 2014 and a macOS port in 2015. 
Oddworld New 'n' Tasty is a re-creation and re-make of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. The game is a 2.5D side scrolling platform and the graphics are in 3D. The cut scenes were made in the game engine. In the new game, there are some new features that the original game didn't have such as QuikSave and having multiple Mudokons following Abe at once. First the game was set to released in the Autumn of 2013 and that was revealed at Eurogamer Expo 2012 by Stewart Gilray, the Development Director of Oddworld Inhabitants and Chief Executive Officer of Just Add Water. Then in November 2013 at the Playstation 4 launch event in the United Kingdom, Oddworld released a story trailer and the trailer said it will be released in Spring 2014. In a podcast by a reporter called TheSixthAxis, Gilray said that the reason why they had to delay the release window was because they switched to a new game engine called Unity nine months during development with the old engine. The game was released on July 22nd in North America and on July 23 in Europe on the Playstation Store for the PlayStation 4 in 2014. In 2015, the PC, Mac and Linux and PS3 ports were released. In 2016, the Wii U and PS Vita versions were released. The game also has leaderboards which give a list of best times for each level, the highest amount of Mudokons saved and best overall time.
In the most recent discussion with Lorne at the Game Developers Conference in California, Lorne told Eurogamer that if New 'n' Tasty sells 250,000 copies, he will have enough money to fund an HD re-make of Abe's Exoddus which is the next project in the series to have an HD Re-make. In 2016, it was confirmed that Oddworld: Soulstorm will be the sequel to w 'n' Tasty. The game is set to be released in 2017. Some footage of the game is yet to be shown.
When Oddworld became digital only in 2010, they released a package for the PC called the OddBoxx. This package contains all four Oddworld games together and they can all be downloaded at once. It is also available on the PS3. In 2013 Oddworld released a bundle called the AbeBoxx for the PS3 which contains all two Abe games.
There are several creatures that live on Oddworld and they act as enemies in the games. These include:
Sligs are like security guards when if Abe is seen, the Slig shouts "freeze!" and kills Abe with it's machine gun. Some Sligs in the game don't say freeze at all and just shoot Abe. There are different variants with the Sligs such as flying Sligs and crawling Sligs. When Abe takes control of the Slig, he has the ability to shout "Look Out!" which makes the native Mudokons duck and it can say "Here boy" to a Slog so that the Slog can kill other Sligs or native Mudokons.
Scrabs are first seen in Scrabania and are creatures which like to kill Abe. They chop him up. They are related to Paramites.
Paramites were first seen in Paramonia which also like to chop up Abe as well.
Slogs are dog-like creatures that live on Oddworld. Sligs train them so that if there is a Mudokon on sight, the Slog will eat him. 
The Glukons are the main enemies in the game. They give orders to the Sligs in Abe's Exoddus and Mullock is the Glukon in the original game.

Make Mine Music

Make Mine Music is a 1946 animated movie, produced by Walt Disney Productions and first released to movie theaters by RKO Radio Pictures on August 15, 1946. The eighth animated movie in the Disney animated movie canon, the movie stars Nelson Eddy, Dinah Shore, Benny Goodman, and The Andrews Sisters.
The movie is made of ten parts, or segments.
During World War II, much of Walt Disney's staff was drafted into the United States Army, and those that were still there were called upon by the U.S. government to make training and propaganda films. As a result, the studio was littered with unfinished story ideas. In order to keep the movie division alive during this difficult time, the studio released four package films including this one, made up of various unrelated segments set to music.
To date, "Make Mine Music" is the only movie in the Disney animated features canon not to gain a Region 4 and Region 2 DVD release. Its only home video release was on DVD on June 6, 2000 under the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection title.
"Make Mine Music" ended up being a slight disappointment itself, particularly from Walt Disney's point of view. It was not well received by the critics either. Years later, the segments were individually released as short subjects or used in various Disney television programs. 
The movie was entered into the 1946 Cannes Film Festival.

Ambulocetus

Ambulocetus ("walking whale") was an early amphibious cetacean. It could walk as well as swim. "Ambulocetus natans" lived from the early Eocene (50 to 48 million years ago). Its fossils have been found in Pakistan. When the animal was alive, Pakistan was a coastal region of India, which was then a large island in the Indian Ocean.
It looked like a 3-meter (10-foot) long mammalian crocodile. It was clearly amphibious: its back legs are better adapted for swimming than for walking on land, and it probably swam by undulating its back vertically, as otters and whales do.
Ambulocetids may have hunted like crocodiles, lurking in the shallows to snatch unsuspecting prey. Chemical analysis of its teeth shows that it was able to move between salt and fresh water. "Ambulocetus" did not have external ears. To detect prey on land, they may have lowered their heads to the ground and felt for vibrations.
Scientists consider "Ambulocetus" to be an early whale because it shares underwater adaptations with them. It had an adaptation in the nose that enabled it to swallow underwater, and its periotic bones had a structure like those of whales, enabling it to hear well underwater. In addition, its teeth are similar to those of early cetaceans.
One mostly complete specimen and several partial skeletons have been found in Pakistan.

Maurice Duruflé

Maurice Duruflé (born Louviers, 11 January 1902; died Louveciennes, 16 June 1986) was a French composer and organist. He was very self-critical and destroyed any of his compositions that he thought were not really good. This is why we now only have a small number of his works. He wrote choral music and music for the organ. His most famous work is his "Requiem".
Duruflé was born in Louviers, Haute-Normandie. In 1912, he joined the choir of Rouen Cathedral where he studied piano and organ. When he was 17 he went to Paris and had private organ lessons with Charles Tournemire. He became Tournemire’s assistant at the Basilique Ste-Clotilde, Paris until 1927. In 1920 Duruflé went to study at the Conservatoire de Paris. His organ teacher was Eugène Gigout. When he graduated he got first prizes in organ, harmony, piano accompaniment, and composition. 
In 1929 Duruflé became organist at St. Étienne-du-Mont in Paris, a job he kept for the rest of his life. 
In 1939, he gave the first performance of Francis Poulenc's Organ Concerto. In 1943 he became professor of harmony at the Conservatoire de Paris, where he worked until 1970. In 1947, Duruflé wrote his famous "Requiem" op. 9, for soloists, choir, organ and orchestra. In the same year Marie-Madeleine Chevalier became his assistant organist at St-Étienne-du-Mont. They married in 1953 after Duruflé divorced his first wife. The couple often travelled together to give organ recitals together. They always spent many hours practising on the organs on which they had to perform, often practising a lot of the time without the sound so that their fingers were really used to the feel of the organ.
In 1975 Duruflé was badly hurt in a car accident and had to give up performing. His wife, who was not so badly hurt in the accident, was still able to play and continued to play the organ at St-Étienne-du-Mont.
Duruflé died in Louveciennes (near Paris) in 1986, aged 84.
Duruflé only left a few of his works for publication. His two important organ works are the "Suite, op. 5" which has a famous Toccata as last movement, and his "Prelude and Fugue sur le nom d'Alain". His "Requiem" remains a favourite work for choirs. Duruflé’s music uses Gregorian plainchant, modal harmonies and polyphonic writing. He was a great admirer of the music of Louis Vierne and Charles Tournemire and he made transcriptions of some of their improvisations.

Sala São Paulo

The Sala São Paulo is a concert hall in the Julio Prestes Cultural Center in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. It is a very large building. The Cultural Center used to be a railway station and it was rebuilt and changed into a cultural centre in 1999.
Sala São Paulo is big enough for an audience of 1.498 people. The orchestra that perform there is the Orquestra Sinfônica do Estado de São Paulo (Osesp).
The Brazilian government wanted to bring more culture to the centre of São Paulo. The rebuilding began in November 1997. 
The original train station was called Julio Prestes Station. It was built between 1926 and 1938 so that trains could take coffee to the port of Santos. When motor car transport became more and more popular many stations connecting Brazilian towns closed down.
The station's large hall was the same shape as many 19th century concert halls, that is, it is shaped like a horse shoe. 
Sala São Paulo has 22 balconies and a ceiling that is 24 meters high. There is a very large platform so that everyone in the audience can see well. There is an elevator to lift the piano on and off the stage and many other useful modern devices.

Bobby Fischer

Robert James "Bobby" Fischer (March 9, 1943 – January 17, 2008) was an American-Icelandic chess Grandmaster and the eleventh World Chess Champion.
As a teenager, Fischer became well-known worldwide because of his skill at chess. He won the American championship of 1963/64, winning all eleven of his games.
Fischer was born in Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, Illinois on March 9, 1943. His birth certificate said that his father was Hans-Gerhardt Fischer, a German. His mother, Regina Wender Fischer, was a Polish-Jewish American citizen. Born in Switzerland, she grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, and later became a teacher, a nurse, and a doctor. The two married in 1933 in Moscow, USSR, where Regina was studying medicine at the First Moscow Medical Institute. They divorced in 1945 when Bobby was two years old, so he grew up with his mother and older sister. In 1948, the family moved to Mobile, Arizona, where Regina taught in an elementary school. The next year, they moved to Brooklyn, New York.
A 2002 article in "The Philadelphia Inquirer" said that Paul Nemenyi, a doctor, was Bobby's biological father, not Hans-Gerhardt. Regina and Nemenyi had had an affair in 1942, and he gave her money to help her raise her child every month, paying for Fischer's schooling until he died in 1952. Fischer later told the chess player Zita Rajcsanyi that Nemenyi sometimes came to his Brooklyn apartment and took him to places.
Fischer learned to play at the age of six. His sister Joan bought him a chess set. Bobby learned how to play from the instructions. Several years later, he began to play at the Manhattan Chess Club. He became well known around the world in 1956. He was 13 when he played a game against an American player named Donald Byrne. In the game, he sacrificed his queen and won. "Chess Review" called this game the "game of the century".
Fischer was 14 when he won the U.S. Championship for the first time. This would be the first of eight U.S. Championships he would win.
In 1972, he became the first and only American to win the World Chess Championship in the 20th century. In the 19th century, Paul Morphy was briefly the leading player. Wilhelm Steinitz was the first official world champion. He became an American citizen while he was champion. To win the title, Fischer beat Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union. The match was held in Reykjavík, Iceland. However, Fischer did not agree to a match to defend his title. He lost his title in 1975. The title of world champion was given to Anatoly Karpov.
Fischer did not play in any public matches or tournaments for nearly 20 years. In 1992, he defeated Spassky in a rematch in Yugoslavia. The United States Department of State had told him not to play there because of the events that happened after Yugoslavia began splitting into several new countries. Since he disobeyed this order, he could have been prosecuted if he returned to the U.S. In fact, he never returned there. Fischer's 1992 rematch against Spassky was the only time after becoming the world champion that Fischer played chess in public.
After his match, Fischer promoted a new type of chess called "Fischer Random Chess", where the pieces were randomly shuffled before the game so they would be on different squares to start every game.
In July 2004, Fischer was arrested at an airport in Japan with a bad passport. The United States wanted Japan to send him back to go to trial for playing chess in Yugoslavia in 1992. The government of Iceland eventually decided to make Fischer a citizen of Iceland. Fischer was sent there, and he lived there for the rest of his life.
Fischer died of renal failure on January 17, 2008. He was buried at a small ceremony near the town of Selfoss, Iceland.
Fischer was born Jewish, but he rejected the religion. He used many racist and reasonable insults toward Judaism. Fischer denied the Holocaust. He read books such as "Mein Kampf" and "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion". As a young man, Fischer joined the Radio Church of God. He later left this evangelical Protestant church with outspoken comments. Fischer had a Catholic funeral. It is unclear whether he became a Roman Catholic before his death.
Fischer, like Morphy, chose to stop playing when he was still young. He had a lifelong history of disputes, conflicts and controversy. He believed he was the victim of conspiracies. Fischer showed symptoms of the mental illness paranoia, similar to Morphy. In "Bobby Fischer: The Wandering King", authors Hans Böhm and Kees Jongkind write that Fischer's radio broadcasts show that he was "out of his mind ... a victim of his own mental illness".
Fischer has developed his own book to teaching chess. It uses a method called programmed learning.

List of World Chess Champions

World Chess Champions are players who have won a match or tournament for the World Championship at chess. Both men and women can become champion, but no woman has ever been a challenger for the title. There is, however, a separate championship for women. There are also separate championships for specific age groups. 
Before 1886, there was no official championship held, but some players were thought to be pre-eminent. From 1948 on, the World Chess Federation FIDE held the championships. Between 1993 and 2006 there were two world champion titles, the FIDE one and the classical one.
The 2013 World Championship match took place between Anand and Magnus Carlsen (challenger) in Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu, where Anand grew up. Usually, world championships had been played on neutral ground. Fischer played Spassky in Iceland; Alekhine played Capablanca in Buenos Aires. The Soviets always played in Moscow. However, sponsorship is needed for these matches, and the decision to accept the Chennai bid was taken by FIDE. The Challenger was victorious winning 3 games and achieving the necessary 6.5 points to win the title at the end of game 10. Magnus Carlsen, 22 and from Norway is therefore the current World Chess Champion.
These players are included (pre-18th century) on little more than opinion, and (18th century) on the basis of more substantial information. Some authors of important early works on chess are noted.
These players are included on the basis of their winning matches against credible opponents. Champions are numbered from Steinitz onwards, because his match against Zukertort was publicly declared as a world championship and generally accepted.
Long matches, initially best of 24 games.
These knock-out events are separately numbered.
These are matches of the traditional kind, and of 15 or 20 games.
Variously, 12-game classical match format and double-round all-play-all tournament.

Phosgene

Phosgene is the chemical compound with the formula COCl. This gas has no color. The gas was used as a weapon during World War I. It is responsible for most of the deaths related to poison gas during the war. Today, phosgene is used as a tool. It is used for organic synthesis. When there is a small amount in the air, the smell is similar to that of freshly cut hay or grass. Some soldiers during the First World War have stated that it smelled a little like May Blossom. When some compounds of chlorine burn or break down, small amounts of phosgene are given off. 
Today, most phosgene is used to produce isocyanates. The most important isocanates in this context are toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI). Both are precursors to polyurethanes. Large amounts are also used to produce polycarbonates. Polycarbonate is produced from its reaction with bisphenol A. Polycarbonates are an important class of engineering thermoplastic. They can be found in lenses in eyeglasses.
Phosgene is a strong poison. Its smell may not be noticed. Signs of exposure may sometimes be detected slowly.
Phosgene can be seen at 0.4 parts per million. This amount is four times the safe amount. Its high ability to poison doesn't come from the hydrogen chloride released by a process. It comes from the action of the phosgene on the proteins in the pulmonary sac of the lungs. The sacs are where the oxygen goes into the body. Their damage makes it hard for the blood and air move oxygen and carbon. This will make breathing very hard. Badges are worn by those at risk of exposure.
Sodium bicarbonate may be used to make spills of phosgene harmless. Gas spills may be made harmless with a special liquid spray.

WrestleMania XIV

WrestleMania XIV was the fourteenth WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event made by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), which took place on March 29, 1998 at the Fleet Center in Boston, Massachusetts.
The night began with the secret guests in the tag team battle royal being revealed as the united Legion of Doom, with Sunny. Savio Vega was first eliminated, meaning his tag team partner, Miguel Perez, had to leave too. Kurrgan illegally entered the ring to get revenge on Sniper and Recon for The Jackyl, Barry Windham also illegally entered to eliminate Bradshaw, and so his partner, Chainz, had to leave too. The final four teams stayed in the match for a while until Skull was eliminated by Phineas. When The Godwinns (Phineas & Henry) were thrown out, they returned and attacked the Legion Of Doom with buckets before leaving. New Midnight Express tried to keep Animal out of the ring while double teaming Hawk but once he re-entered the Legion eliminated Bob and Bart at the same time, leaving them the last team standing.
The second bout was a Light Heavyweight Championship match, with Taka Michinoku defending his title against Águila; this would be the first and only time the championship was defended at WrestleMania, though the title that came after it, the WWE Cruiserweight Championship would be. After throwing Taka out the ring and baseball sliding into him, Águila hit an moonsault outside the ring, but was soon hit by a springboard crossbody after Taka reversed a suplex from the end of the ring. Águila almost won the match with a moonsault crossbody into a pin but stayed on the offensive with a frankensteiner. Taka tried to land the Michinoku Driver but as Aguila flipped out and attempted a hurricarana, Taka reversed it into a powerbomb. Taka would soon stop Águila from hitting him with a high flying dive with a dropkick before before being able to do a Michinoku Driver and get the win. After the match, they shook hands and celebrated together.
Triple H made his way to the ring with his theme song played by the DX Band. Before Owen Hart came to the ring, Commissioner Slaughter handcuffed himself to Chyna so that she would not get involved in the match, despite her saying that she didn't want to. The match began with Hart attacking Helmsley with his fists before sliding out of the ring, when Triple H tried to jump from the end of the ring he landed on the crowd barrier. After an powerbomb Hart tried to lock in the sharpshooter but Helmsley broke out of it and started some offensive attacks of his own, kicking Hart in the turnbuckle and delivering a suplex. Hart suffered a cut to the bridge of his nose from a boot to the face, after which Triple H began to only attack Hart's damaged ankle, dropping his knee onto it and stretching it. After not getting hit with another kick to the face and pulling Helmsley's crotch onto the ring post, and managed to take advantage, changing a powerbomb into the sharpshooter but Chyna, having to pull Sgt. Slaughter, pulled Triple H to the rope for the break. Chyna then threw white powder in Slaughter's face causing a worried Hart to check on him, as he turned round to face the ring, Chyna low-blowed him from outside allowing Triple H to win the match with the Pedigree. After she was freed from the handcuffs, Chyna shoved Slaughter into the crowd.
Marc Mero and Goldust began the match but Goldust soon tagged in Luna Vachon, requiring Sable to be tagged in too. However, Vachon simple ran around the outside of the ring with Sable chasing her and tagged her partner back in. Wanting to get her hands on Vachon, Sable double teamed Goldust with a boot to the face after an Irish whip from Mero but could not get Vachon to enter the ring. An near pinfall came from a running crossbody from Mero and following this the two ran into each other, causing both men to crawl and tag in the women. Sable straddled Vachon and punched her round the face before kicking her in the mid-section and face in the turnbuckle and attacking Goldust, then running back to clothesline Vachon over the ropes. Vachon tagged Goldust in but before Sable would do the same, she struck him in the face, then letting Mero take over who had his TKO reversed into a DDT. Mero too would reverse the Curtain Call allowing him the chance to try a moonsault pin to a standing Goldust. After Vachon struck a running Mero with his knee, Mero went to punch her but ducked out of the way as Goldust ran to her rescue, causing him to inadvertently knock her off the apron. Mero then executed the TKO but Luna interrupted the pin count, jumping on Mero's back resulting in Sable tagging in as Mero wandered around the ring with Vachon on his back. Sable tried pinning Goldust but the referee was distracted and as he finally began to count, Sable leapt off Goldust so the interfering Vachon would inadvertently bodysplash Goldust. Sable then performed a powerbomb and Mero's TKO to win the bout.
The Intercontinental title fight began along the walkway with a brawl that saw Ken Shamrock whipped into the steel steps before coming inside the ring. Rocky Maivia then delivered his People's Elbow but could not secure a three-count. Shamrock then rolled out of the ring and grabbed steel steps and when the referee tried to take it off him, he threw the referee into the corner; The Rock quickly grabbed the steps and hit Shamrock with it as the referee recovered. Shamrock pushed out of the pin count and quickly gained the advantage, delivering a belly to belly slam off an Irish whip and then securing his ankle lock in the centre of the ring, making The Rock tap. The surrounding members of the Nation jumped into the ring but Shamrock quickly dispatched them all with suplexes, including the four hundred pound Henry, before reapplying the ankle lock to a bleeding Maivia. Faarooq then ran down from the back and jumped onto the apron, only to look on at The Rock with a smile, before walking away. Eventually a number of referees and officials appeared trying to subdue Shamrock, after being surrounded he suplexed a referee and then an official before calming down as The Rock was wheeled away on a gurney. Howard Finkel then announced Shamrock had been disqualified for not breaking his ankle hold causing Shamrock to chase Rock and fight him on the Chris Warren band stage.
The Tag Team Championship match began with Billy Gunn facing Chainsaw Charlie and Road Dogg exchanging blows with Cactus Jack. Trying a Cactus Elbow on Road Dogg, Cactus missed and slammed himself into the dumpster. The Outlaws then focused on Charlie, using a back toss to drop him into the dumpster and as he attempted to climb out they simultaneously slammed the lid shut on the hardcore legends' heads. With Cactus and Charlie both in the dumpster, the Outlaws shut the lid down on them but Cactus managed to get back up while the Outlaws were celebrating and pushed Road Dogg down to the ground with a mandible claw, pulling him into the dumpster. Both teams took time to recover and began to brawl with weapons in the ring, Cactus Jack pulling out a ladder and climbing it opposite Billy Gunn, only to be pushed off straight into the dumpster outside the ring by a falling Chainsaw Charlie. Road Dogg pulled his partner out and the two focused their efforts on Charlie, powerbombing him into the dumpster, however Cactus had managed to escape in the meantime. The fight found its way to the backstage area, with both Outlaws throwing Cactus into boxes and promotional toys but Jack replied with a chair shot to both of them and pulled Billy Gunn onto a wooden crate with a double-arm DDT. Charlie reappeared on a forklift and elevated the wooden crate as Jack dragged Road Dogg onto it too. Charlie then drove the forklift above a backstage dumpster and dropped both opponents inside as Cactus Jack closed the lid to win the World Tag Team Championship.
Before The Undertaker's match with Kane, baseball record-holder Pete Rose came to the ring as the special ring announcer. However, after insulting the home-town team and introducing Kane, the wrestler gave him a tombstone piledriver starting a tri-year tradition. The Undertaker was preceded by a league of torch-bearing druids to the tune of O Fortuna. The Undertaker cornered Kane and threw a fury of punches into him, ducking and reversing Kane's attempts until Kane hit him with a clothesline that he instantly sat up from. Kane then set Undertaker up in a tree of woe to begin his assault of punches and Irish whips and then suplexing Undertaker onto the ropes and delivering a flying club to the neck from the turnbuckle. As Undertaker began to fight back, Kane threw him into the ropes but his brother retaliated by jumping onto his back, which was met a face-first electric chair. Paul Bearer kept the referee distracted while Kane landed the steel steps onto Undertaker, and repeated the effort a second time while his opponent was lying onto the steps, crushing him between. As the referee tried to keep Kane in check, Bearer slapped Undertaker while walking past him. Kane caught his brother running and delivered a chokeslam but lifted his shoulders off the mat before the three count could be made, putting him into a sleeper hold that Undertaker eventually fought out of with a flurry of punches. Undertaker then dropped Kane on top of the ropes and punched him off the apron; he followed this with a over the top rope suicide dive that Kane managed to side-step, guiding him through the Spanish announce table. As Undertaker made it back into the ring, Kane hit him with a flying lariat. Undertaker was caught unawares by Kane, who lifted him into a tombstone piledriver position, but Kane managed to weigh himself backwards onto his own feet and deliver the tombstone himself. Undertaker kicked out and after landing his opponent with a clothesline, he chokeslammed Kane and then delivered a tombstone piledriver of his own; it would eventually take three tombstones with a guillotine leg drop and flying clothesline in between to stop Kane kicking out and sitting up but as soon as the match was over Bearer attacked Undertaker and ordered Kane attack him, which he did with a chair shot to the head and then a tombstone piledriver onto the chair. After Kane and Bearer left, Undertaker sat up and left the ring.
With Mike Tyson enforcing from ring side, the WWF Championship fight began with both superstars dancing around each other, engaging in a few light punches before Shawn Michaels escaped the ring and ran back in to take advantage of Steve Austin, but was met with a standing clothesline. Austin followed up by pulling down Michaels' trunks revealing his rear. Michaels tried to run at Austin but was flipped over the top rope into Triple H and Chyna. As Triple H threw Austin through the crowd barrier, the referee ordered him and Chyna to leave ringside but Austin followed and fought with them up to the entrance way. Michaels caught up with him and hit Austin with a cymbal from the bandstage, before Irish whipping him into the dumpster. As the match resumed in the ring, Austin met Michaels high-risk manoeuvre with a clothesline and then ran him into the turnbuckle and picking him up for an inverted atomic drop. Michaels attempt to pick up some momentum saw him picked up and dropped onto the ropes but Michaels managed to push Stone Cold away as he attempted a stunner. When he tried to escape the ring though, Austin shoved him forcing the champion to fall upon the announce table. After Stone Cold slowed the match down with a sleeper, Michaels tried to pull his knee into the ring post but was instead pulled into it himself. Austin then tried to rush at Michaels but was back tossed into the crowd and struck with the ring bell. Michaels used the momentum to take advantage inside the ring, delivering a snapmare and then a low kick to the grounded Austin but as he took time to offend the audience Stone Cold briefly picked up some speed throwing Michaels out of the ring but just as quickly lost ground as his opponent repeatedly worked on Austin's left knee, throwing it into the ring post and then kicking and dropping onto it back inside the ring. When Austin tried to recover outside of the ring, he was met with a baseball slide launching him over the announce table and was instantly thrown back into the ring by Tyson where he soon suffered a figure four leg lock that Michaels illegally elevated using the second and third ring rope. Austin's eventual counter was stopped by a rope break. Austin then tried to reverse a standing sleeper hold by throwing Michaels back into the turnbuckle but unwittingly trapped referee Mike Chioda who fell unconscious. With both men on the floor, HBK recovered with a kip-up and landed a high-flying elbow drop, getting in position to taunt for his finisher. As Austin eventually stood up, he ducked the super kick, attempting a stunner on Michaels as he turned round only to be thrown into the ropes and met again with a Sweet Chin Music which he grabbed, spinning Michaels round and finishing with a Stone Cold stunner. Tyson jumped into the ring to make a quick three count and the new champion celebrated by tossing the enforcer an Austin 3:16 t-shirt. When Shawn Michaels stood up, he confronted Tyson about his turn but was met with a punch that instantly floored him, and draped with Austin t-shirt.

New Netherland (Dutch: "Nieuw-Nederland", Latin: "Nova Belgica" or "Novum Belgium") was a colony of the Dutch Empire from 1614 through 1664 and from 1673 through 1674. It was a base for the fur trade. The capital was New Amsterdam, modern-day New York City. The other important trading post in New Netherland was Fort Orange, now called Albany, New York. Most settlers lived in these towns or between them, along the Hudson River but some lived in distant parts of the colony. 
During the Anglo-Dutch Wars England conquered New Netherland and divided it to make the English colonies of New York and New Jersey. The English also gave parts of it to Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland.

Workstation

A workstation is a computer used for scientific or technical calculations, or purposes. These computers are usually expensive, high-end computers. They are different from the ordinary computers used for text-processing. Very often they have operating systems that allow several users to work at the computer at the same time. Very often, workstations are connected to a computer network. Computer terminals may be used to access them. Currently, almost all workstations use a unix or unix-like operating system.
Workstation computers often use a 64-bit server-class CPU such as the Intel Xeon or AMD Opteron, and some have more than one CPU. They may also have more memory than a normal desktop computer, and they often have 10000 or 15000 RPM hard drives or solid-state drives. Some workstations have devices that are not commonly used on normal desktop computers, such as ECC (error-corrected) memory, SCSI, fibre channel, and 10 gigabit Ethernet.
Some technologies that were once only found on workstations have now become common in normal PCs, such as multi-core processors, solid-state drives, hardware-accelerated graphics, 24-bit color, broadband Internet access, virtual memory, pre-emptive multitasking, and OpenCL.
Common uses for workstations include computer-aided design (CAD), 3D graphics and animation, video and audio production, weather modeling, and other simulations and scientific work.
Traditionally, workstations used a RISC processor, such as MIPS, PowerPC, or SPARC architecture CPUs. Modern workstations use x86_64 processors.

Plan 9 from Bell Labs

Plan 9 from Bell Labs is a free software distributed operating system. It was for research purposes as the successor to UNIX by the Computing Sciences Research Center at Bell Labs during the late 1980s. Plan 9 is currently used as a hobbyist's operating system, and in certain experimental fields, where the highly distributed nature of the operating system is valued. Plan 9 has novel features such as the 9P protocol for accessing local and remote resources as files, union mounts, an improved proc file system, and native unicode support throughout the system. In Plan 9, all system interfaces, including those required for networking and the user interface, are represented through the file system rather than specialized interfaces. It also has a graphical user interface built in, called rio, in anticipation of the graphical world.
The name Plan 9 from Bell Labs is a reference to the Ed Wood 1959 cult science fiction movie Plan 9 from Outer Space. Also, Glenda, the Plan 9 Bunny, is presumably a reference to Wood's film Glen or Glenda.
Plan 9 was originally developed for research purposes, as Bell Labs was looking for a replacement for the venerable UNIX. It underwent mass testing, as all the computers at Bell Labs had Plan 9 installed, in lieu of UNIX, which was commonplace previously. It explored several modifications to the pre-existing UNIX system, primarily the distributed nature of the system, and the graphical user-interface. In 1992, Bell Labs released a public version, for universities, and soon after, a version for the general public. The highly restrictive nature of the licence at the time, and the steep 500$ licencing fee resulted in it being ignored, in lieu of Linux.
When Lucent-Alcatel acquired Bell, in the 1990s, however, funding for the system was slashed, and in 2000, it was released into the world under a FOSSy licence. In February 2014, Alcatel-Lucent permitted the University of California, Berkeley to release Plan9 under the popular GNU General Public License.

Carnegie Hall

Carnegie Hall is a concert hall in New York. The money for building it was given by Andrew Carnegie, a very rich businessman from Scotland. Carnegie Hall was built in 1891. It is the most famous concert hall in the world.
Carnegie Hall has three separate concert halls: the Main Hall, the Recital Hall and the Chamber Music Hall.
Carnegie Hall's main auditorium is big enough to seat 2,840 people. There are five levels. The main hall was named after the violinist Isaac Stern in 1997. The Main Hall is very tall, and visitors to the top balcony must climb 105 steps. 
For many years the world-famous New York Philharmonic Orchestra gave their concerts there. They moved out to a new concert hall in the Lincoln Center in 1962. Many of the greatest performers of classical music have performed in the hall. Concerts continue to be given there including, more recently, concerts of popular music.
Zankel Hall, which seats 599, is now named after Judy and Arthur Zankel. At first it was simply called Recital Hall, then in 1896 it was renamed Carnegie Lyceum. It was used by the American Academy of Dramatic Arts from 1898. In 1959 it was changed into a cinema. Since 1997 it has been a hall for recitals. 
The Weill Recital Hall is a small concert hall seating just 268 people. Since 1986 it has been named after Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Carnegie Hall's board, and his wife, Joan. At first it was called Chamber Music Hall, later Carnegie Chamber Music Hall).
The official opening night was on May 5, with an orchestral concert conducted by Walter Damrosch and the composer Tchaikovsky. Many famous works were given their world premiere (first ever performance) at the Carnegie Hall, including "Symphony No. 9, opus 95, "From the New World"" by Antonín Dvořák on December 16, 1893, the "Sinfonia Domestica" by Richard Strauss - March 21, 1904, conducted by the composer, "Concerto in F" by George Gershwin on December 3, 1925, with the composer playing the piano, and "Variations on a Theme of Corelli" by Sergei Rachmaninoff - November 7, 1931, with the composer playing the piano.
The world premiere of Disney's animated film "Fantasia 2000" took place at Carnegie Hall on December 17, 1999.

Vienna New Year's Concert

The New Year Concert of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra is a concert of classical music that takes place each year on the morning of 1 January in Vienna, Austria. The concert hall where they are held is called the Wiener Musikverein. The music traditionally consists of waltzes, marches and polkas by the Strauss family. The concert is shown on television to about one billion people in 44 countries.
The music always includes pieces from the Strauss family (Johann Strauss I, Johann Strauss II, Josef Strauss and Eduard Strauss). The music consists mainly of waltzes, polkas, mazurkas and marches. Sometimes other Austrian composers are included. In 2009, for the first time, music by Josef Haydn was played. It was the 4th movement of Haydn's Symphony No. 45, known as the "Farewell Symphony". It was performed because the year 2009 is the 200th anniversary of Haydn's death. 
These concerts have been held in the "Großer Saal" (Large Hall) of the Wiener Musikverein since 1939. Since 1980 the flowers that decorate the concert hall are a gift each year from the city of Sanremo, Liguria, Italy. On television the viewers can also see ballet dancers who dance to the music. These dancers are often dancing in Schönbrunn Palace, Schloss Esterházy, the Vienna State Opera or in the Wiener Musikverein itself.
The concert always ends with three encores after the main programme. The first encore is a fast polka. The second encore is Johann Strauss II's "Blue Danube Waltz". The audience start to clap as soon as the music for this famous waltz starts. The last encore is the "Radetzky March". The audience like to clap along to the music.
The concert was first performed in 1939.

Ender's Game series

The Ender's Game series (sometimes called Enderverse) is a series of books written by Orson Scott Card. There are 2 major series of the Ender's Game series: the Ender series and the Shadow series.
The Ender series includes the books "Ender's Game", "Speaker for the Dead", "Xenocide", and "Children of the Mind". "Ender's Game" used to be a short story, but the author expanded it to make the novel "Ender's Game".
The Shadow series (also called the "Bean Quartet") starts with "Ender's Shadow", followed by 4 other books about the lives of the people Ender left behind. "Ender's Shadow" occurs at the same time and place (Battle School) as "Ender's Game" does, but instead in the view of Bean rather than Ender. "Shadow of the Hegemon", "Shadow Puppets", and "Shadow of the Giant" are stories about world dominace on Earth after the Bugger War in which the children at Battle School and Ender's older brother, Peter Wiggin, are main characters. "Shadows in Flight", a sequel to "Shadow of the Giant", is planned to come out; however, it will start after "Children of the Mind", not "Shadow of the Giant", and will combine the two Ender's Game series: the Ender series and the Shadow series.
There are 11 stories in the Ender's Game series. According to Orson Scott Card, the author, you do not have to read the books in any required order, except that Xenocide should be read right before Children of the Mind.
The books can be read in the order they were written/published in or by date times in the novels.

Southern cassowary

The southern cassowary ("Casuarius casuarius"), also known as double-wattled cassowary or two-wattled cassowary, is a large flightless black bird with hard and stiff plumage, two dangling red wattles and a big bony lump on its head called a casque. It lives in tropical rainforest and feeds mostly on fallen fruit, red nape and two red wattles hanging down its throat.
The big female lays up to five enormous glossy green eggs on the ground. She then leaves the male bird to sit on them and raise the stripey chicks. The cassowary is a very rare bird in Australia but also lives in New Guinea.

Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education

The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE) is the second largest provider of higher education in Pennsylvania after the Commonwealth system and a large public university system in the United States. It is the tenth-largest university system in the United States and 43rd largest in the world. The system is made up of 14 state-owned schools, all of which are NCAA Division II members.
The "Normal School Act of 1857" was passed on the last day of session on 20 May 1857. Its passage created 12 school districts. Afterward, the School Code of 1911 mandated that Pennsylvania purchase all the schools. The "normal" schools evolved from state normal schools, to state teacher's colleges, to state colleges. Act 188, which was signed into law on November 12, 1982 and came into effect on July 1, 1983, established the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, and converted those state colleges into universities.
The system is made up of the following 14 universities in Pennsylvania:
PASSHE universities also operate four branch campuses. The Office of the Chancellor is situated in the capital city of Harrisburg at the Dixon University Center.

George Foreman Grill

The George Foreman Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine, commonly known as the George Foreman Grill, is an indoor, electrically-heated grill manufactured by Salton, Inc. George Foreman, a former champion boxer, is the main spokesperson for the grill. Since its introduction in 1994, over 80 million Foreman grills have been sold.
Foreman has made over 150 million dollars from the sales of his grills, an amount that is more than he earned as a boxer.
The company has created many different sizes and designs for the grill since it was first made. These include "The Champ" which was the first grill produced, a family size grill, and a "Super Large" grill that has 144 inches of grilling space. There is also a deep fryer and roaster.
A website made an April Fools' Day joke by claiming to sell a USB version of the grill called the "iGrill." The fake product was advertised as a grill that can be plugged into a computer and turned on by someone on the Internet.

Mandatory access control

In computer security, a mandatory access control (MAC) means a type of access control by which the operating system changes the way a "subject" (e.g. a user or a program) can access or do some sort of action on an "object" (e.g. a file or folder). Subjects and objects each have a set of security rules. Whenever a subject tries to use an object, the operating system kernel looks at these security rules and decides whether the subject can use the object.

<doc id="151286" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=151286" title="Access control">
Access control

Access control is the ability to allow or deny the use of a certain object by a certain person or entity. Access control machine can be used in managing physical objects (such as a movie theater, to which only people with tickets are allowed in) or digital objects (for example, a private text document on a computer, which only certain users should be able to read).
Because every person’s fingerprint, iris, voice, retina, face, hand, vein and signature are unique, a biometric time clock provides a quick, accurate, and reliable way to record who is accessing an object or place. That is why many companies now employ biometrics (systems that identify people based on a body part).
In recent times, there are large number of biometric systems that are commercially available. Such biometric systems are based on unique characteristics of human being. The most common, reliable and successful system is the one based on fingerprints. Users are supposed to put their thumb/index finger (or any specified finger) in the finger reader. The system then compares the fingerprint that is read with the one in the central database for authentication.
Most biometric systems do not keep an image of the fingerprint but a template. A template is basically a number that is calculated based on various characteristics of the fingerprint. This is done so that persons may not sneak unauthorised images of fingerprints into the database. When a fingerprint is to be matched, its "template number" is computed and compared with that stored in the database. Most systems allow for dry, greasy, chaffed and minor cuts on the fingers. The other biometric systems are based on retina of the eye, palm, photograph or voice pattern recognition. The palm-based systems take the image of the palm from various angles and compare them.

HMHS Britannic

The HMHS "Britannic" was a British passenger ship. The ship was also used as a war ship and a Royal Mail steamer. The "Britannic" was finished on 26 February 1914, for the White Star Line. It was a sister ship to the Olympic and the RMS Titanic. The building of the ship was held up when the Titanic sunk, and extra safety items were added to the Britannic.
The start of World War I meant the ship was not used for passenger work. It was set up as a hospital ship with 3,300 beds. She sailed to Mudros on the 23 December 1915, to pick up wounded soldiers from Gallipoli. She continued as a hospital ship until 1916 when it was turned back into a Royal Mail and passenger ship. Before this latest change was carried out, the ship was called back into war service and went back to Mudros.
On 21 November 1916 the "Britannic" hit a naval mine in the Zea Channel, off the Greek island of Kea. The mines had been put there by the German submarine U-73. A huge explosion tore a hole in the side of the ship which sunk one hour later. The ship which was carrying 1,125 people, and nearly all were saved. Two lifeboats were struck by the ship's propellers and 30 people were killed.
The German newspapers claimed that the ship had been sunk by a torpedo because it might have been carrying soldiers. The captain of the U-73 said this was not true, he had only been laying the naval mines.

A-League

A-League is an association football (soccer) league which is the top division in Australia and New Zealand.
Unlike professional soccer leagues in most of the rest of the world, the A-League has what is called a "franchise" system—the same teams play in the league each year, unless a team drops out of the league on its own, or the league decides to add one or more new teams. This system is normal for pro sports leagues in Australia, as well as in the United States and Canada.
The A-League, like other professional leagues in Australia, crowns its champion at the end of a knockout playoff series involving top teams on the regular-season table. The final match is called the Grand Final, a term used in several other Australian sports. The team that finishes on top of the regular-season table is called the "Premiers". Media sometimes incorrectly call the Premiers the "minor premiers", a term used in other football codes in the country.

North American Soccer League (NASL) is the name of two men's soccer leagues that played at different times in North America.
The first NASL had teams in the United States and Canada, and was the top level of the sport in both countries. It played between 1968 and 1984.
The second NASL began play on April 9, 2011 with teams in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico. It is the second level of the soccer pyramid in both the U.S. and Canada, behind Major League Soccer. Puerto Rico has its own soccer league, but it plays at a level below the NASL.
At that time the NASL was the top league in the league pyramid.
The most successful team in the old NASL were New York Cosmos with five titles.

<doc id="151506" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=151506" title="Propositional logic">
Propositional logic

Propositional logic is a formal system in mathematics and logic. Other names for the system are "propositional calculus" and "sentential calculus". The system is made of a set of propositions. Each proposition has a truth value, it is either true or false. Propositions can be joined together using logical connectives to make new propositions. Examples for logical connectives that are used often are logical and, logical or, logical if, logical if and only if and logical not.
Propositional logic only looks at the propositions and how they are connected, it does not decompose the propositions. That way, the proposition "All cats are dogs and the earth is a disc" is made of two propositions, "All cats are dogs", "The Earth is a disc". These are joined together with AND. 
There are other logic systems that build on propositional logic. One of these is Predicate logic, which defines logical predicates, and looks at how they can be applied to arguments. Another system is called modal logic. It introduces two new junctors "it is possible, that" and "it is necessary, that".
A simple logic statement is "If P, then Q". For example, "If it rains for an hour, then the ground will be wet". Note that there are two logic errors that people often make from this:
1) "If Q, then P". In our example, this would mean "If the ground is wet, then it has been raining for an hour". However, the ground could be wet for other reasons, like if snow has melted or a water main has broken.
2) "If not P, then not Q". In our example, this would mean "If it has not been raining for an hour, then the ground is not wet". However, the ground could still be wet for the reasons listed above.
The only correct inference that can be made is "If not Q, then not P". This means, in our example, "If the ground is not wet, then it has not been raining for an hour".

Transmission Control Protocol

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite. TCP is part of the popular "TCP/IP" combination used by the Internet. The Internet Protocol, or IP, makes sure data on the internet gets to the right place. Then TCP makes sure the data is put in the right order, and none of it is missing. TCP also helps to control traffic on the internet so it does not get overloaded. These protocols, which are kind of like languages that computers use, are designed so that any computer, and any program (such as a Web browser or e-mail client), can use them.
TCP makes it easier for computer programs to communicate with each other, typically over a computer network. When a program wants to send a lot of data, TCP is in charge of dividing the data, sending it through the network, and putting it back together correctly on a different computer. In the process, IP chooses which wires and "intersections" get used to send all the data pieces in the fastest way. It does this using packets.
If there are a lot of people using the network, it can get overloaded. Also sometimes weather, power outages, and other problems can make communication hard. Routers on the Internet use something called "load balancing" to try to fix some of these problems. But still, information can be delivered out of order, get lost, or even duplicated. TCP is designed to notice all of these problems and try to fix them. This can take a while, which is why the Internet sometimes seems slow. Once the TCP receiver has finally reassembled a perfect copy of the data originally transmitted, it passes that data to the computer program that asked for it. In this way, the program does not have to know about the network, and TCP does not have to know about the program's data.

Monologue

A monologue is a long, uninterrupted speech or poem by one person. The person may be speaking his or her thoughts aloud or directly addressing other persons, e.g. an audience, a character, reader, or inanimate object.
The term 'dramatic monologue' is used both for monologues in plays and for the poetic genre.
A rant (also called harangue or declamation) is a monologue that does not present a well-researched and calm argument; rather, it is typically an attack on an idea, a person or an institution, and very often lacks proven claims. 
Some rants are used not to attack something, but to defend an individual, idea or organization. Rants of this type generally occur after the subject has been attacked by another individual or group.
Rants are used often in situations requiring monologue. Comedians, such as Lewis Black, Adam Carolla, and Rick Mercer, use rants as a way to get their message or punch-line across to the listening audience.
A rant can be used to flame members of an email group or electronic mailing list that are failing to reach a consensus on an issue.

Stanley Ann Dunham (November 29, 1942 – November 7, 1995), the mother of Barack Obama, the 44th President of the United States, was an American anthropologist. She was later known as, Ann Dunham, Ann Obama, Ann Soetoro, Ann Sutoro (after her second divorce) and finally as Ann Dunham. Dunham spent her childhood in California, Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas. Dunham spent her teenage years in Mercer Island, Washington. Much of her adult life was spent in Hawaii. 
Dunham was born in Saint Francis Hospital in Wichita, Kansas. She is the only child of Madelyn Lee Payne and Stanley Armour Dunham. She was mostly of English ancestry, with some German, Swiss, Scottish, Irish, and Welsh ancestry. Wild Bill Hickok is her sixth cousin, five times removed.
Ancestry.com announced on July 30, 2012, after using a combination of old documents and yDNA analysis, that Dunham's mother may have been descended from African John Punch, who was an indentured servant/slave in seventeenth-century colonial Virginia.
In 1995 in Hawaii, she died of uterine cancer which spread to her ovaries. Following a memorial service at the University of Hawaii, Obama and his sister spread their mother's ashes in the Pacific Ocean at Lanai Lookout on the south side of Oahu. Obama scattered the ashes of his grandmother (Madelyn Dunham) in the same spot on December 23, 2008, weeks after his election to the presidency.
Obama talked about Dunham's death in a 30-second campaign advertisement ("Mother") arguing for health care reform. The ad featured a photograph of Dunham holding a young Obama in her arms as Obama talks about her last days worrying about expensive medical bills. The topic also came up in a 2007 speech in Santa Barbara:
I remember my mother. She was 52 years old when she died of ovarian cancer, and you know what she was thinking about in the last months of her life? She wasn't thinking about getting well. She wasn't thinking about coming to terms with her own mortality. She had been diagnosed just as she was transitioning between jobs. And she wasn't sure whether insurance was going to cover the medical expenses because they might consider this a preexisting condition. I remember just being heartbroken, seeing her struggle through the paperwork and the medical bills and the insurance forms. So, I have seen what it's like when somebody you love is suffering because of a broken health care system. And it's wrong. It's not who we are as a people.

Canadian Albums Chart

The Canadian Albums Chart is the official album sales chart in Canada. It is compiled every Wednesday by U.S.-based music sales tracking company Nielsen Soundscan, and published every Thursday by "Jam!" Canoe, along with its sister charts the Canadian Singles Chart and the Canadian BDS Airplay Chart.
The chart consists of 200 positions, however, "Jam!" only publishes the top 100 for the public. Unlike the case with its CD single equivalent (the Canadian Singles Chart), album sales are not declining as rapidly in Canada as CD singles are, and the Canadian Albums Chart remains the most reliable source for the most popular albums in Canada.

<doc id="151645" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=151645" title="Megamouth shark">
Megamouth shark

The megamouth shark ("Megachasma pelagios") is a large, slow-swimming, timid shark that was only discovered in 1976. It grows to 5.5 metres long. The megamouth is found in the Indian, Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans.
The megamouth shark has a sturdy body, and a fat, round and long head. The snout is very short and wide. The gill slits are quite long but can not reach the dorsal surface of the head. The mouth is wide, with the corners extending behind the eyes. The first dorsal fin is located more closely to the pectoral fins than to the pelvic fin, and the second dorsal fin is less than half the size of the first dorsal fin. Both dorsal fins are low. The pectoral fins of the adults are shorter than the head in length. 
The dorsal surface of the body, the pectoral and pelvic fins, the dorsal fins, the center of the anal fin, and the caudal fin are blackish-brown. The belly is white.
The shark has around fifty rows of very small teeth on each jaw, but only three rows are usable. Females seem to have fewer teeth rows than males. The upper and lower jaws have a symphyseal (where the two halves of the jaw meet) toothless space, but it is larger in the upper jaw. A difference between the upper and lower teeth was recognized on a female specimen: the first five upper teeth are smaller than the first five lower teeth.
The maximum length reported for the Megamouth shark is 5.5 metres (18 feet). Males mature when they are 4 metres (13 feet) long, and females mature when the are 5 metres (16 feet) long.
Although there has only been a total of 53 confirmed sightings of the Megamouth shark, this species is now known to be found in the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. As with the two other known filter-feeding sharks, the basking shark and the whale shark, this species has a widespread distribution. However, the megamouth shark is less active, and a poorer swimmer than the basking shark and the whale shark. Its slow movement is probably because of its fleshy body, soft fins, and asymmetrical tail.
The only confirmed register of a Megamouth shark predator is an event of when sperm whales where seen attacking a Megamouth shark. This occurred in Manado, North Sulawesi, Indonesia (30th August 1998) near midday, while some researchers were observing the whales. The base of the dorsal fin and the gills of the shark showed signs of the whales' attack.
Although there have only been a few sightings of the megamouth shark, it is believed that this species of shark likes to live in the open ocean. The sixth specimen found was tagged and followed for two days, allowing insight into its habitat preference and behaviour. It stayed at a depth of 15 metres during the night, then dove to 150 metres at dawn and returned to shallow waters at dusk. So the megamouth is presumed to be a vertical migrator on a 24 hour cycle, spending the daytime in deep waters and ascending to midwater depths at night. This vertical migration may be a response to the movements of the small animals on which it feeds. The krill that make up part of the megamouth's diet also migrate from deep waters to the surface.
The megamouth shark is one of the three giant filter-feeding sharks in the sea. The other two are the basking shark and the whale shark.
The exact details of the feeding behaviour of the megamouth shark is unknown, due to the few observations on a live, feeding specimen. The megamouth has a huge mouth that extends behind the eyes. Scientists believe that this shark swims slowly through groups of krill and other small prey with its mouth open, and sucks them in. Then it closes its mouth, and this action decreases the pharyngeal volume and makes it possible for the shark to get rid of any water through the gill openings.
All the specimens of the megamouth shark which have been studied have had krill in their stomach, indicating a filter-feeding habit. The stomach of the first megamouth captured had only one type of krill, "Thysanopoda pectinata". The second megamouth's stomach had krill, copepods, and the jellyfish, "Atolla vanhoeffeni".

Toothpaste

Toothpaste is a part liquid paste, applied to the bristles of a toothbrush in order to aid oneself with the act of toothbrushing.
This substance has several purposes, such as removing plaque from one's teeth, whitening one's teeth and freshening one's breath.
Several toothpaste brands specialize in caring for teeth sensitive to certain conditions (for example heat, cold) or flavours (such as sweetness). The majority of these products work by strengthening the tooth enamel, thus easing discomfort and providing the teeth with a protective outer layer.
Traditionally, toothpaste has a minty flavour, as this is said to allow a sense of freshness in the mouth. However, fruit and flavours have been popular in the past. Fruit toothpastes, however, are discouraged by dentists due to their acidic and tooth-eroding properties.

Karl Goldmark

Karl Goldmark (born Keszthely, Hungary, 18 May 1830; died Vienna 2 January 1915) was a Hungarian composer. His music was largely forgotten for a long time after his death, but is now starting to be played much more.
Goldmark came from a large Jewish family. He was one of 20 children. His father was a chazan to the Jewish congregation at Keszthely. He learned to play the violin and was sent to Vienna to study music. After the Revolution of 1848 the Conservatory had to close down and so he had to teach himself how to compose. He earned money by playing the violin in theatre orchestras and by teaching music. For a short time one of his pupils was Jean Sibelius.
Wagner's music was an influence on his compositional style. However, he could not form a proper friendship with Wagner because of Wagner's antisemitism.
Goldmark composed six operas, including "Die Königin von Saba" ("The Queen of Sheba"). It was very popular during his lifetime and continued to be performed by the Vienna State Opera until 1938. His Violin Concerto No. 1 was also very popular indeed, then it lay forgotten for many years. It is very Romantic and sounds very Hungarian.
Other works include a symphony called "Ländliche Hochzeit" (Rustic Wedding) and several other orchestral works, some chamber music and choral music.

Ferruccio Busoni

Ferruccio Busoni (1 April 1866 - 27 July 1924) was an Italian composer, pianist, teacher and conductor.
Ferruccio Busoni was born in Empoli in Tuscany in Italy. His parents were both musicians. His father played the clarinet and his mother played the piano. They were often touring when Ferruccio was young. He spent most of his childhood in Trieste.
Busoni was a child prodigy. He first played the piano in public at the age of seven. Two years later he played some of his own compositions in Vienna. The composer Franz Liszt heard him. He also met Liszt, Johannes Brahms and Anton Rubinstein.
For a short time he studied in Graz, then in Leipzig. He taught in several places including Helsinki, where he met Jean Sibelius as well as a young lady was to be his wife. In 1890 he won the Anton Rubinstein Competition with his Concert Piece for Piano and Orchestra. He taught in Moscow in 1890, and in the United States from 1891 to 1894 where he also toured as a virtuoso pianist.
In 1894 he went to Berlin where he stayed. He performed as a pianist and conductor and taught many gifted pianists. 
He wrote a book called "Sketch of a New Aesthetic of Music". He did not agree with the strict rules that were used by most teachers for teaching composition. He thought that music was "born to be free". His thinking influenced his composition pupils who included Percy Grainger, Kurt Weill and Edgard Varèse.
During World War I, Busoni lived first in Bologna, where he was director of the conservatory, and later in Zürich. He refused to perform in any countries that were involved in the war. He returned to Berlin in 1920 where he gave master classes in composition. 
Busoni died in Berlin from a kidney disease. 
Busoni's music is based on the Romantic style, but it also starts to sound quite modern. He uses a lot of complicated counterpoint. Sometimes it is quite atonal. A lot of it is based on music of the past. He made many transcriptions, including piano transcriptions of several works by Johann Sebastian Bach.
Busoni was a virtuoso pianist, and his works for piano are difficult to perform. His "Piano Concerto" is extremely hard to play as well as being extremely long (about 70 minutes). The British pianist John Ogdon, who played it, called it "the longest and grandest piano concerto of all".
Some of his best known works include his suite for orchestra "Turandot" which he made into an opera, and his opera "Doktor Faust" which he had not finished when he died. It was finished by his student Philipp Jarnach, but in the 1980s Anthony Beaumont made a better version of it.
Busoni made a number of piano rolls, and a small number of these have been re-recorded onto CD. People who knew him disagree about whether these piano roll recordings show his playing at his best.

BBC Radio 4 Extra is a British digital radio station. It plays comedy, drama, and children's programmes 24 hours a day. It was called BBC 7 when it started in 2002 and was later renamed BBC Radio 7 in 2008. 
Not many people knew what Radio 7 was, so its name was completely changed in 2011 to make it sound closer to BBC Radio 4, which is run by the same person.
The shows on Radio 4 Extra are mostly old programmes which were once on BBC Radio 4, although they have made some new programmes. It can be heard on digital (DAB) digital radios and also on the Internet.

Chinese herbology

Chinese herbs do not grow in China only. If you find the right climate and soil type, you can grow many of those herbs overseas. For instance, American Ginseng is grown in Wisconsin State.
The raw herbs available in retail have the following natural features:
How do people take the raw herbs? Raw herbs are usually taken orally by extracting the essence out of them. The natural way being practiced since ancient time is to boil and brew the herbal package in water to get a dark brown solution called herb tea that never tastes good. One hour of brewing should be good enough. Then you drink one or two cups a day. Honey or sugar may be added to make it taste less bad. The herbal package can be conveniently modified by changing some ingredients to make it work for you. So an herbal package is really tailor-made for you only.
Raw herbs can be dried and grounded into a powder then compressed into a tablet which is better than buying your own tablets or having to buy gel capsules
Raw herbs can be made into capsules at home. All you need is a tailor-made package of raw herbs. Turn it into fine powder with a powerful grinder, and put the powder into empty gel capsules. When you swallow the capsules, your digestive system has to extract the essence out of the raw herb powder. Whereas if you drink the herb tea, the essence extraction is already done after brewing. The herbal solution will readily be absorbed by your body. Furthermore, the herb tea has a history spanning over two thousand years. How many years of history does the tablet or capsule have besides offering convenience?

(1)The terms used here reflect typical TCM usage (as translated literally from individual Chinese characters), and may not reflect their meanings in TCM, namely, meanings that are normative, figurative or metaphorical when read in context. The meanings of these terms are therefore different from that in common English usage. In particular, they are not to be used for purposes of self-diagnosis, much less for self-medication. For example, "Xia Huo" means "To reduce fire", but "fire" here does not refer to combustion involving oxygen. Even within TCM, there are various meanings of "fire", and it can refer to "real" or "false" fire. The 3 herbs mentioned above cannot be used to reduce "false fire", or fires of yin deficiency in the zhang organs.
(2) An example of the non-literal use of transliterated characters is "long gu" which literally means "dragon bones". This term cannot possible refer to Chinese dragons, since they do not exist. However, one can easily buy "long gu" from any TCM herbal shop. Another term that cannot be taken literally is "di long" which literally means "earth dragon".
(3) Although the above herbs are common in TCM prescriptions, they cannot be purchased if we refer only to their Latin names. One likely reason is that TCM pharmacists rarely, if ever, use the Latin names of the herbs. The Chinese names, or the transliterated names (pinyin) should be used instead. For example, if we ask for "flos Lonicerae" we will almost certainly get a blank look. However, if we ask for "Jin Yin Hua" or 金银花 we will connect immediately, even though the pharmacist may speak any of the large number of Chinese dialects (such as Cantonese, where the herb is known as "Kum Gen Fa", or Golden Silver Flower, in Hong Kong). Wherever possible, use the written form (金银花) to avoid miscommunication and/or mis-pronunciation, since there is no dialect form of the written language.
(4) There are a large number of synonyms of the herb names, in both Chinese, English and Latin. This makes it even more essential to use the written form of the Chinese names to ensure accuracy.
(5) Some herbs are prone to adulteration, substitution, or both. For example, Ling Zhi Cao (Cordyceps) can be substituted with an inactive form of the herb. If an extract is first made with water, the herb will be tasteless when dried and re-used/recycled. On the other hand, the genuine Ling Zhi tastes bitter, but few consumers would know the difference, especially if the herb is mixed in a prescription and boiled together with other herbs. The pharmacists themselves may not be aware, as some may trust their suppliers implicitly, and do not conduct regular testing.
(6) Animal-based "herbs" are prone to substitution or adulteration, including Xiong Dan (bear bile / gall bladder) which looks very much like Niu Dan (bovine bile /gall bladder) when the gall bladder is dried, although Niu Dan is far less bitter in taste. Some are simply unavailable because they are banned in many countries. These include tiger parts, such as Hu Gu (tiger bone) which is substituted by bobcat bone, and Chuan San Jia (scales of the pangolin) which has no animal-based substitute. Niu Huang (bovine gallstone) is unavailable in many Western countries and Singapore because of its potential impact on pregnant women, although Niu Huang Pills with about 2% of Niu Huang are available in many Asian countries.

According to Pierre de Marca, a famous historian, the name "Ogenne" can be traced back to the 11th century. It was first called "Ogene" in the 11th century, then "Oiena" in the 13th century. In around 1350 it was called "Sent-Jacme d'Ojenne", and in 1385 it was called "Oyene." Finally in 1548 it was called "Ogena".
The name "Camptort" comes from the 13th century. It was first called "Campus tortus" in 1235. It was called some other names: "Cam-tort" (1385), "Quamptort" (1540), "Sanctus Stephanus de Camptort" (1674), "Cantor" (1755), and "Camptor" (1793.)
Two streams run through the town. One stream is the Saley, a tributary of the Gave d'Oloron (a river). The other stream is the Laà, a tributary of the Gave de Pau (also a river.)

Rocket engine

A rocket engine is a device that produces a force by pushing gases at high speed out of a nozzle. Rocket engines burn chemicals such as petroleum and liquid oxygen at very high pressures and temperatures to turn the chemical energy into motion. In some cases (such as NASA rockets), the force created can be over .
A garden hose shows how moving fluid can create a force. When a hose is turned up the hose will snake around unless it is held still. The exiting water is creating a force on the hose just like how the rocket engine gases push on the rocket engine.
Some rocket engines burn liquid fuels while some burn solid fuels. Solid fuel rocket engines are sometimes called "rocket motors".
Liquid fuel rocket engines often require complex pumps and valves to properly move (and pressurize) the liquids from the fuel tank to the actual engine. These machines must work in extreme temperatures and pressures. Liquid oxygen is very cold (-223˚C) while the engine is very hot (3000˚C), and the pressure is oftentimes hundreds of times higher than normal air pressure. Because of these conditions, liquid fuel rocket engines are often very complex and require very specialised materials (metals, ceramics, etc.).
Solid fuel rocket motors have the fuel (called propellant) as a solid mixture of an oxidizer and fuel. An oxidiser supports the burning of fuel much like oxygen supports burning. The common oxidiser is powdered Ammonium Perchlorate, while the common fuel is powdered aluminum metal. The two powders are stuck together with a third component known as the binder. The binder is a rubbery solid that also burns as a fuel. The simple idea makes solid rocket engines cheaper, but they cannot be turned off or controlled, and are more likely to explode than liquid rocket engines. Solid rockets also provide a smaller specific impulse, hence must be heavier to launch the same payload.
Military missiles commonly use solid rockets because they can be kept ready for many years. Many satellite launchers use solid rocket boosters when they start, but liquid rockets for the majority of the flight. 
Hybrid rocket engines combine the two ideas. The two propellants are different states of matter, often with liquid oxidisers and solid fuels. They are not used much, but might be safer than solid rocket motors or liquid rocket motors

Penny Black

The Penny Black was the world's first adhesive postage stamp. It was issued by the United Kingdom on the 1 May 1840 and used from the 6 May the same year. All London post offices received official issues of the new stamps, but other offices in the country did not. Some post offices like in Bath, offered the stamp unofficially after 2 May. 
Once the stamps were used, they had a red cancellation. However, it was hard to see, and it could easily be taken off. It is not very rare. The total print run was 286,700 sheets with 68,808,000 stamps. A mint condition stamp might fetch £3–4,000.

Penny Red

The Penny Red was a postage stamp issued in 1841 to replace the Penny Black. It was the main type of postage stamp in the United Kingdom until 1879. The design was hardly changed at all. 
The colour was changed from black to red because it was hard to see the red cancellation mark on the Penny Black. It was easier to see a black cancelling on a Penny Red. It is not a very rare stamp.

Line of succession to the British throne

The line of succession to the British throne is the order in which members of the royal family would come to the throne if the reigning king or queen died or abdicated.
At present the first in line is Charles, Prince of Wales, followed by his elder son, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and then Prince William, Duke of Cambridge's son, George. 
Traditionally, males came before females in the line of succession. However, the law changed on 26 March 2015, so at present, for people born after 28 October 2011 the succession is decided only by age: older children come before younger children. When someone who is in line to the throne has a child, that child comes after them and their older children, but before anyone else in the line of succession.
Excluded from the line of succession are Catholics and illegitimate children.
No official, complete version of the line of succession is currently maintained. Any person's actual position in the line of succession may change when people are born or when they die. This list shows only those people who are descended from the sons of George V.

Two Penny Blue

The Two Penny Blue (or 2d Blue) was the world’s second official adhesive postage stamp. It was issued in the United Kingdom in May 1840. It was more or less the same as the Penny Black. 
It was intended that the 2d blue was to be issued at the same time as the Penny Black. However the earliest post mark seen on a Two Penny Blue was the 8 May 1840 which is two days after the penny black was issued. The Two Penny Blue is much rarer and more expensive than the Penny Black.

Mugello region

Mugello is a landscape north of Florence in northern Italy. It is separated by the Santerno River's valley by the Futa Pass.
In ancient times it was on the border between the area settled by the Ligurians (the Magelli tribe, whence the name), the Etruscans and the Gauls. The Roman colonization left sparse traces, as the Mugello was mostly an agricultural area. In the Middle Ages it was home to numerous castles, and was later acquired by the Republic of Florence. Several families of the city built there partician villas, like those of the Medici in Cafaggiolo and the Trebbio. Recent is the creation of the artificial Lake of Bilancino on the Sieve (river) river.
The area gave name to the Mugello Circuit (Autodromo Internazionale del Mugello) which is a race track that hosts an annual Moto GP event.

Friar

Friars are special monks that do a service to a community and that lead a simple life, rather than living like ascets in a monastery.
There are two classes of orders known as friars, or mendicant orders: the four "great orders" and the so-called "lesser orders". 
The four great orders were mentioned by the Second Council of Lyons (1274), and are:

<doc id="152340" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=152340" title="Samael">
Samael

Samael () (also Sammael and Samil) is an archangel in Talmudic and post-Talmudic beliefs and stories, as well as Christian tradition and demonology. There are also other religions that believe in stories of Samael. Samael is often thought to be both good and evil. It is said that he was the guardian angel of Esau and a patron of the sinful empire of Rome. 
Samael is often confused with Satan because he often has grim and destructive duties. He is often considered a fallen angel, like Satan and the chief of the evil spirits. One of Samael's roles in Jewish beliefs is that of the Angel of Death. In this belief, he is a fallen angel but remains one of the Lord's servants. As a good angel, Samael supposedly lives in the seventh heaven, although he is said to be the chief angel of the fifth heaven. 
The website Catholic.org says Samael is a "Power", which means he is the chief of many warrior angels.
Powers are warrior angels against evil, who defend the world and people. They fight against evil spirits who attempt to bring chaos through human beings. The chief is said to be either Samael or Camael, both angels of darkness.
In Jewish beliefs, Sammael is said to be the Angel of Death, the ruler of the Fifth Heaven, and one of the seven regents of the world served by two million angels; he resides in the Seventh Heaven. "Yalkut I, 110" of the Talmud says Samael is Esau's guardian angel. In "Sotah 10b", Samael is Esau's guardian angel.
In the "Sayings of Rabbi Eliezer", he is said to be the one who tempted Eve, then seduced and impregnated her with Cain. Some sources identify Gadreel as the angel that seduced Eve; although, other Hebrew scholars say that it was Samael who tempted Eve as the Serpent. 
Samael is also sometimes said to be the angel who wrestled with Jacob, and also the angel who held back the arm of Abraham as he was about to sacrifice his son.
According to "The Ascension of Moses" (Chapter IV - Aggadah - The Legend of The Jews - By Louis Ginzberg) Samael is also mentioned as being in 7th Heaven:
"In the last heaven Moses saw two angels, each five hundred parasangs in height, forged out of chains of black fire and red fire, the angels Af, "Anger," and Hemah, "Wrath," whom God created at the beginning of the world, to execute His will. Moses was disquieted when he looked upon them, but Metatron embraced him, and said, "Moses, Moses, thou favorite of God, fear not, and be not terrified," and Moses became calm. There was another angel in the seventh heaven, different in appearance from all the others, and of frightful mien. His height was so great, it would have taken five hundred years to cover a distance equal to it, and from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet he was studded with glaring eyes, at the sight of which the beholder fell prostrate in awe. "This one," said Metatron, addressing Moses, "is Samael, who takes the soul away from man." "Whither goes he now?" asked Moses, and Metatron replied, "To fetch the soul of Job the pious." Thereupon Moses prayed to God in these words, "O may it be Thy will, my God and the God of my fathers, not to let me fall into the hands of this angel."
In "The Holy Kabbalah" (Arthur Edward Waite, 255), Samael is described as the "severity of God", and is listed as fifth of the archangels of the world of Briah. Samael is said to have married Lilith after she left Adam. According to Zoharistic cabala, Samael was also mated with Eisheth Zenunim, Na'amah, and Agrat Bat Mahlat - all angels of prostitution.
Samael is sometimes confused in some books with Camael, an archangel of God, whose name means "He who sees God".
Samael is shown as a character in the Megami Tensei video game series. The archangel is shown in the games as a blood-red serpent. He is a member of the Vile Clan and is a persona of the Death Arcana. 
In the Silent Hill video games, Samael is the name of one of the town's gods. He is shown as an anthropomorphic goat.
In the film Hellboy, one of the main characters is a giant hell-hound called Sammael, who Hellboy nicknames "Sammy".

The Basilica di Santa Croce (Basilica of the Holy Cross) is the main Franciscan church in Florence, Italy. It is a minor basilica of the Roman Catholic Church. It is situated on the Piazza di Santa Croce, about 800 metres south east of the Duomo. When the site was chosen, it was a marshland outside the city walls. Many very famous Italians, such as Michelangelo, Galileo, Machiavelli, Foscolo, Gentile, Rossini, and Marconi are buried inside the church. For this reason, the church is also known as the "Pantheon of the Italian Glories" ("Tempio dell'Itale Glorie" or "Pantheon dell'Itale Glorie").

Dandy

A dandy (also known as a beau or gallant) is a man who dresses elegantly and fashionably. He exaggerates his manners, including the way he stands and moves, and the way he speaks. He promotes himself. This is called dandyism. The word 'Dandy' was originally a version of 'Andrew'. The female equivalent is a "dandizette".
The word "dandy" first came out in the Scottish verse of about 1780:
<poem>I've heard my granny crack
O' sixty twa years back
When there were sic a stock of Dandies O.</poem>
Dandies in the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States and Great Britain were often men from middle-class backgrounds who were trying to become people from high society.
The model, or archetype, of a dandy was Beau Brummell from the Regency period of George IVth. He was a friend of the then Prince of Wales. Lord Byron is also an example. The writer Oscar Wilde is another, later example. Less extreme versions were the American artist who lived in London, James McNeill Whistler, and the French composer Maurice Ravel. "The Scarlet Pimpernel" is a famous example from literature.
Today, in the 21st century, the word "dandy" is often used as a joke word to mean "fine" or "great".

Africa Province

The Roman province of Africa was established after the Romans defeated Carthage in the Third Punic War. It roughly includeded the territory of present-day northern Tunisia, north-eastern Algeria and the Mediterranean coast of modern-day western Libya along the Syrtis Minor. The Arabs later named roughly the same region as the original province Ifriqiya, an other word for "Africa".
The prosperity of most towns depended on agriculture. Called the "granary of the empire", North Africa, according to one estimate, produced one million tons of cereals each year, one-quarter of which was exported. Additional crops included beans, figs, grapes, and other fruits. By the second century, olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item. In addition to the cultivation of slaves, and the capture and transporting of exotic wild animals, the principal production and exports included the textiles, marble, wine, timber, livestock, pottery and wool.

Third Punic War

The Third Punic War (149 BC to 146 BC) was the third and last of the Punic Wars. It was fought between the former Phoenician colony of Carthage, and the Roman Republic.
The war was a much smaller engagement than the two previous Punic Wars, and was mostly just the Romans attacking the city of Carthage in the Battle of Carthage. The Romans killed or captured all the people living inside of the city, tore down the buildings, and put salt in the earth so that plants wouldn't be able to grow. They did this because they hated the Carthaginians after fighting two other wars with them, and didn't want to fight another, so they totally destroyed them!

Punic Wars

The Punic Wars were three wars fought between Rome and Carthage between 264 and 146 BC, and were probably the largest wars in the ancient world. They are known as the "Punic" Wars because the Latin term for Carthaginian was "Punici" (older "Poenici", from their Phoenician ancestry).
The main cause of the Punic Wars was the clash of interests between the existing empire of Carthage and the expanding Roman Republic. Carthage lost the three wars.
Carthage was a trading nation founded by Phoenicians. It was the dominant sea power in the western Mediterranean. It was a maritime empire, in contrast to the land-based Roman empire. The Romans decided they needed Sicily, which was then in Carthaginian hands. The consequence was a series of wars which lasted over a hundred years, and ended in the utter destruction of Carthage.

Notts County F.C.

Notts County Football Club is a football club in Nottingham, England, and the oldest of all the clubs that are now professional. The club now plays in Football LeagueOne of the Coca-Cola Football League, part of the English football league system. "The Magpies" play at the Meadow Lane stadium in black and white striped shirts.
The club has also played many times in the top division of English football, the most recent in 1991–92, when they played in the last season of the old First Division before the creation of the Premier League.
Well-known past managers of Notts County have been Jimmy Sirrel, Neil Warnock, and Sam Allardyce.
Notts County started in 1862. The club was started before The Football Association and in the beginning they played a game with club rules, rather than association football. When it started, Notts County, like most sports teams, were considered to be a "gentlemen-only" club. Notts County are thought to be to be one of the starters of the current game, even being credited with the invention of the offside trap. Notts County is the oldest of the world's professional association football clubs (There are older professional clubs in other codes of football.)
The club in the beginning played at Park Hollow at Nottingham Castle. In December 1864, the decision was made to play games against outside teams, and it was decided that the club needed to find a larger venue. After playing at several places, The Magpies settled at Trent Bridge Cricket Ground in 1883.
In 1888, Notts County, along with eleven other football clubs, became a founding member of The Football League. They finished their first league season in eleventh place. Notts County got their highest ever league finish of third in 1890-91, and they also finished third ten seasons later.
On 25 March 1891, Notts County reached the FA Cup final for the first time but did not win.
Notts County made up for this in 1894, when they won the FA Cup at Goodison Park for the first time in their history. The Magpies beat Bolton Wanderers 4-1 and Jimmy Logan scored the first hat-trick in FA Cup final history. Notts County became the first club outside the top division to win the FA Cup - they finished in third place in the Second Division that season.

2 Girls 1 Cup is the title of the trailer for Hungry Bitches, a scat-pornographic movie produced by MFX Media. The trailer features two women deficating into a cup, taking turns eating the fecis, and throwing it up into each other's mouths. "Lovers Theme" from Hervé Roy's Romantic Themes album released by Tele Music in 1992 plays throughout.
This one-minute video is a viral video that became a well-known Internet meme among bloggers and message boards for its viewers reaction to the content. Around mid-October 2007, video sites such as YouTube were flooded with videos that show others' reactions to watching the video for the first time.
The video came from a Brazilian, Marco Fiorito, who talks of himself as a "compulsive fetishist". Fiorito first produced foot fetish videos but soon moved on to coprophagia. The movie was made by MFX-Video, one of several businesses owned by Fiorito. Fiorito says his movies are legal in Brazil, but authorities in the United States have branded some of his movies as dirty and filed charges against Danilo Croce, a Brazilian lawyer living in Florida, listed as an officer of a company shipping Fiorito's movies in the United States. Croce accepted a plea bargain and was sentenced to 3 years of unsupervised probation and forfeiture of $420 yolo sweg. Fiorito said he did not know his movies were illegal in the United States and that his movies often contained chocolate instead of feces to appease some of his actors who were willing to appear in scat movies but not actually eat fecal matter.
The first few seconds of the 2 Girls 1 Cup video contain the text "MFX 420" (the product code for "Hungry Bitches") and the URL mfxvideos.com. The website is Fiorito's MFX-Video. This causes some in the media to incorrectly believe the video is one of the many Croce had to surrender to the Department of Justice but was somehow leaked in the process.
2 Girls 1 Cup's spread because of the reactions it causes. Hundreds of videos exist on YouTube of users showing the original video to their friends and recording their reactions. Even Joe Rogan, host of "Fear Factor", a show known for the nasty things its players eat, had to turn away in a reaction video posted to his blog. A reaction video starring Kermit the Frog proved very popular on the Digg. In January 2008, "Slate" magazine wrote about the reaction video with a slideshow about the reactions.
Violet Blue, an author, stated this website as becoming "the new 'tubgirl' and goatse all in one nasty moment of choco-poo-love" in a "San Francisco Chronicle" article.

Page replacement algorithm

Certain operating systems use paging to get virtual memory. This means that a part of the hard disk or a file is used so that the applications or the operating system see more memory that is actually there. A Page replacement algorithm is an algorithm that decides which pages should be written to disk or file, when a new page needs to be allocated. 
Some of the algorithms used are:

Page cache

A page cache or disk cache is a buffer of pages certain operating systems keep in memory. These operating systems usually use paging. 
The page cache uses virtual memory techniques to cache file data as pages rather than as file system oriented blocks. Caching file data is far more efficient than caching through physical disks blocks. Several systems - including Solaris, Linux, and Windows NT, 2000, and XP - use page caching to cache both process pages and file data. This is known as Unified Virtual Memory.

User Datagram Protocol

The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the core members of the Internet Protocol Suite, the set of network protocols used for the Internet. With UDP, computer applications can send messages, sometimes known as "datagrams", to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network without requiring other communications to set up special transmission channels or data paths. UDP is sometimes called the Universal Datagram Protocol. The protocol was designed by David P. Reed in 1980 and formally defined in RFC 768.
UDP applications use datagram sockets to establish host-to-host communications. Sockets bind the application to service ports that functions as the endpoints of data transmission. A port is a software structure that is identified by the port number, a 16 bit integer value, allowing for port numbers between 0 and 65,535. Port 0 is reserved, but is able to be used if the sending process does not expect messages in response.
Ports 1 through 1023 (hexadecimal 0x3FF) are named "well-known" ports and on Unix-like operating systems, binding to one of these ports requires superuser (root) access.
Ports 1024 through 49,151 (0xBFFF) are registered ports.
Ports 49,152 through 65,535 (0xFFFF) are used as temporary ports usually by clients when communicating to servers.
There are many uses for UDP, for example BitTorrent optionally uses it for peer-to-peer file sharing. The Teredo tunneling protocol uses UDP.

Cache coherence

A cache can be used to improve the performance of accessing a given resource. When there are several such caches for the same resource, as shown in the picture, this can lead to problems. Cache coherence or Cache coherency refers to a number of ways to make sure all the caches of the resource have the same data, and that the data in the caches makes sense (called "data integrity"). Cache coherence is a special case of memory coherence.
There may be problems if there are many caches of a common memory resource, as data in the cache may no longer make sense, or one cache may no longer have the same data as the others. A common case where the problem occurs is the cache of CPUs in a multiprocessing system. As can be seen in the figure, if the top client has a copy of a memory block from a previous read and the bottom client changes that memory block, the top client could be left with an invalid cache of memory,without knowing. Cache coherence is there to manage such conflicts and maintain consistency between cache and memory.
Coherence defines the behavior of reads and writes to the same memory location. The caches are coherent, if all of the following conditions are met:
These conditions are defined supposing that the read and write operations are made instantaneously. However, this does not happen in computer hardware because of memory latency and other aspects of the architecture. A write by processor X may not be seen by a read from processor Y if the read is made within a very small time after the write has been made. The memory consistency model defines when a written value must be seen by a following read instruction made by the other processors.
Distributed shared memory systems mimic these mechanisms so that they can maintain consistency between blocks of memory in loosely coupled systems.
The two most common types of coherence that are typically studied are Snooping and Directory-based. Each has its own benefits and drawbacks. Snooping protocols tend to be faster, if enough bandwidth is available, since all transactions are a request/response seen by all processors. The drawback is that snooping is not scalable. Every request must be broadcast to all nodes in a system. As the system gets larger, the size of the (logical or physical) bus and the bandwidth it provides must grow. Directories, on the other hand, tend to have longer latencies (with a 3 hop request/forward/respond) but use much less bandwidth since messages are point to point and not broadcast. For this reason, many of the larger systems (>64 processors) use this type of cache coherence.

Barry Marshall

Barry James Marshall, AC, FRS, FAA (born 30 September 1951) is an Australian doctor and winner of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He is Professor of Clinical Microbiology at the University of Western Australia. Marshall is well known for proving that bacteria "Helicobacter pylori" are the cause of most stomach ulcers. This changed years of medical belief which said that ulcers were caused by stress, spicy foods, and too much acid. He has recently taken a part-time position at the Pennsylvania State University.
Marshall was born in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. He lived in Kalgoorlie and Carnarvon until moving to Perth at the age of seven. He went to high school at Newman College, Perth. At the University of Western Australia, medicine and surgery. He married his wife, Adrienne, in 1972. In 1972 he was also the Western Australian state yo-yo champion.
In 1979 Marshall became a Registrar in Medicine at the Royal Perth Hospital. At the hospital he met Robin Warren, a pathologist who was interested in gastritis. They were both training in internal medicine at Royal Perth Hospital in 1981. Together they looked at spiral bacteria in gastritis. In 1982 they grew a culture of "H. pylori". They worked on their idea that there was a bacterial cause of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer. Their idea was laughed at by scientists and doctors who did not believe that any bacteria could live in the acidic stomach. Marshall said that "Everyone was against me, but I knew I was right". Other doctors said they wouldn't believe it until the "H. pylori" idea could be proved.
Marshall and Warren tried to give the bacteria to piglets in 1984, but it did not work. Marshall drank some of the bacteria and soon developed gastritis with achlorhydria. He had stomach discomfort, nausea, vomiting and bad smelling breath. On the 14th day of the infection, biopsies of Marshall's stomach did not show any bacteria. His body may have got rid of the bacteria without help. His wife made him take antibiotics immediately so there was no way of checking the negative result again. He did not develop antibodies to H.pylori. This means that natural immunity can sometimes get rid of H.pylori infection. His illness and recovery, showed the link between "H. pylori" and gastritis, but not for peptic ulcer. This experiment was published in 1985 in the Medical Journal of Australia and is among the most cited articles from the journal.
After this work at Fremantle Hospital, Marshall did research at Royal Perth Hospital (1985-86) and at the University of Virginia, USA (1986-1996), before going back to Australia. He held a Burnet Fellowship at the University of Western Australia from 1998-2003. He is still looking at "H. pylori" and runs the H.pylori Research Laboratory at UWA.
In 2005, the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm gave the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Dr. Marshall and Dr. Warren for finding the bacterium "Helicobacter pylori" and its part in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease.
Marshall was given other awards including:
He was made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2007.

Sweetwater, Florida

Sweetwater is a city of Florida in the United States.
During the 1920s, the Miami-Pittsburgh Land Company bought land near Miami. They planned to build "Sweetwater Groves." In 1926, a category 4 hurricane, (the Great Miami Hurricane), struck the area. Between the hurricane and problems with real estate value at the time, this construction never happened.
In 1938, Clyde Andrews bought most of the "Sweetwater Groves" land and began to sell it for homes. A group of Russian midgets were some of the people who bought the land. They were looking for a place to retire after their career in the circus. They built several homes on the land. These homes were not built for people of normal height. The homes were built smaller than normal so that the group would be comfortable living in them. This caused Sweetwater to be called the "midget" community for many years. Sweetwater became incorporated in 1941. . The first mayor of the town was the manager of the group of midgets. The town grew to a population of about 500 people by 1959. In 1970, Sweetwater was still a small town. It's population was about 3000.
During the 1970s, Sweetwater began to grow quickly. In 1972, Florida International University began teaching students at its campus just south of the town. Two large highways were being built in the area. One north of the town and the other to the west of it. The area also got noticed by the Dade County Hispanic community. All of this caused the population of Sweetwater to double. The town had the largest growth of all cities in Dade County during the 1970s.
The City's population is currently over 14,200 people. Ninety-three percent of the population is of Hispanic origin.

West Palm Beach, Florida

West Palm Beach is a city of Florida in the United States. West Palm Beach is the county seat of Palm Beach County, Florida. In 2007 there were about 99,377 people living in West Palm Beach. 
The city was founded by Henry Flagler as a community to house the servants working in the two grand hotels on the neighboring island of Palm Beach, across Lake Worth. The original spelling was "Westpalmbeach", but it was feared that the 13-letter word would be a bad omen for the new community. On November 5, 1894, 78 people met at the "Calaboose" (the first jail and police station located at Clematis St. and Poinsettia, now Dixie Hwy.) and passed the motion to incorporate the Town of West Palm Beach in what was then Dade County (now Miami-Dade County). This made West Palm Beach the oldest incorporated municipality in the county and in South Florida. The town council quickly addressed the building codes and the tents and shanties were replaced by brick, brick veneer, and stone buildings. The city grew rapidly in the 1920s as part of the Florida land boom. Many of the city's landmark structures and old neighborhoods were built during this period.
Originally, Flagler intended for his Florida East Coast Railway to end in West Palm but after the area experienced a deep freeze, he chose to extend the railroad to Miami instead.
In the 1960s, Palm Beach County's first enclosed shopping mall, the Palm Beach Mall, and an indoor arena were completed. They led to a short revival for the city, but crime continued to be a serious problem and by the early 1990s there were not many people living or working in downtown. Since the 1990s, developments such as CityPlace and renovation of 1920s architecture on Clematis Street have brought people back to downtown for the entertainment and shopping district.

George Foreman

George Edward Foreman (January 5, 1949) is an American two-time World Heavyweight Boxing Champion and entrepreneur. He was born in Marshall, Texas and grew up in Fifth Ward, Houston.
He became the oldest man ever to win a major heavyweight title when, at 45, he knocked out 26-year-old Michael Moorer in the 10th round. He is still the oldest person to do that and has been named one of the 25 greatest fighters of all time by "Ring Magazine". Nicknamed "Big George", he is now a successful businessman and an ordained Christian minister.
Foreman has ten children, and each of his five sons is named George: George Jr., George III, George IV, George V, and George VI. They are also known by the nicknames "Monk", "Red", "Joe" "Big Wheel" and "Little George". His five daughters are Michi, Georgetta, Freda George, Natalie, and Leola. He also has two adopted daughters. 
Late in the 20th century he has become famous for a line of electric grill products that have his name. The grill products cook the food and allow the fat to drain off into a bowl, making the food less fatty.

<doc id="152761" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=152761" title="SIMATIC">
SIMATIC

SIMATIC is the name of an automation system which was developed by the German company Siemens. The automation system controls machines used for industrial production. This system makes it possible for machines to run automatically. Depending on the needed function of the machine you have to upload the right program on your Simatic unit. This unit is kept in a control cabinet near the machine.
Simatic is similar to a digital computer which can store and run programs. The Simatic also has some inputs and outputs. The running program on the Simatic controls these inputs and outputs. Both are connected by electrical wires with the machine. That makes a communication between the Simatic and any machine possible. As the case may be the inputs and outputs are set on a “High” signal or on a “Low” signal by the program. These are different electrical definitions. Finally these signals are important if an action in the machine happens or not. 
Example for different signals at the output to a motor:
Example for different signals at the input coming from a thermometer in the machine:
There are basically two ways of communication:
In the machine, there are sensors. A sensor gives information about different situations in the machine. For example, how fast the motor rotates, what the temperature is or when the current action is completed. All this information is necessary for the program. The sensors give out an electrical signal, each signal goes by wire on an input of the Simatic unit. So the program knows what´s going on in the machine. This is very important, because now the program can perform the next correct step in its sequence. For example, if the temperature of the motor is too high, the program has to know it. Now the program will switch off the motor.
In the machine, there are actuators. They cause a wanted motion, action or forming. Examples for actuators are a motor, a heater or a light. If the program says that it´s time to switch on the light in the machine, the right output of the Simatic unit will be set. That means that an electrical signal at the output goes by wire to the machine and switches on the light.
The name Simatic is a registered trademark of the company Siemens, since 1958. Simatic connects “Siemens” and “Automatic” in one word.
Siemens developed four different product lines so far:
Every automation system needs a program to control a machine. To create a program you need a software. Siemens created their own software for their products.

Windows Mobile

Windows Mobile is a compact operating system that comes with basic applications for mobile devices.
It is designed to look like desktop versions of Microsoft Windows.
The first version was Pocket PC 2000, released in April 2000. It was based on the kernel of Windows CE 3.0 (Handheld PC 2000).
Then came Pocket PC 2002, released about two weeks before Windows XP. It was similar to 2000, having full compatibility
with Windows CE.
Windows Mobile 2003, released in April 2003, was the first version called Windows Mobile. It was software-compatible with Windows
CE 3.x and 4.x.
Windows Mobile 5 was released around July/August 2005. It was similar to WM2003, except for a few new additions.
Next...
Windows Mobile 6.0 was released in February 2007 and had a kernel powered by Windows CE 6.x.
6.1 in 2008 was much the same, and 6.5, released in 2009/2010, was the last version.
It was discontinued in March 2010 and replaced by Windows Phone.
Microsoft ended sale of Windows Mobile devices on June 13, 2010 and ended all support of it on August 21, 2010.
Two months later, Windows Phone was released.

<doc id="152810" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=152810" title="Sustainable biofuels">
Sustainable biofuels

Biofuels are fuels from plant materials. They offer the prospect of oil price moderation. But the use of biofuels needs to be sustainable. Responsible development of biofuels will help economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and Asia.
There are many biofuel options which are available. Biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, are currently produced from the products of conventional food crops such as the starch, sugar and oil feedstocks from crops that include wheat, maize, sugar cane, palm oil and oilseed rape. Any major switch to biofuels from such crops would create a direct competition with their use for food and animal feed, and in some parts of the world we are already seeing the economic consequences of such competition.
Second generation biofuels are now being produced from the cellulose in dedicated energy crops (perennial grasses such as switchgrass and Miscanthus giganteus), forestry materials, the co-products from food production, and domestic vegetable waste. Advances in the conversion processes will improve the sustainability of biofuels, through better efficiencies and reduced environmental impact of producing biofuels, from both existing food crops and from cellulosic sources.
Lord Ron Oxburgh suggests that responsible production of biofuels has several trade-offs:
Produced responsibly they are a sustainable energy source that need not divert any land from growing food nor damage the environment; they can also help solve the problems of the waste generated by Western society; and they can create jobs for the poor where previously were none. Produced irresponsibly, they at best offer no climate benefit and, at worst, have detrimental social and environmental consequences. In other words, biofuels are pretty much like any other product. 
According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, sound biofuel production practices would not hamper food and fibre production, nor cause water or environmental problems, and would enhance soil fertility. The selection of land on which to grow the feedstocks is a critical component of the ability of biofuels to deliver sustainable solutions. A key consideration is the minimization of biofuel competition for prime cropland.
Crops like Jatropha, used for biodiesel, can thrive on marginal agricultural land where many trees and crops will not grow, or would produce only slow growth yields. Jatropha cultivation provides benefits for local communities: 
Cultivation and fruit picking by hand is labour-intensive and needs around one person per hectare. In parts of rural India and Africa this provides much-needed jobs - about 200,000 people worldwide now find employment through jatropha. Moreover, villagers often find that they can grow other crops in the shade of the trees. Their communities will avoid importing expensive diesel and there will be some for export too. 
Cambodia has no proven fossil fuel reserves, and is almost completely dependent on imported diesel fuel for electricity production. Consequently, Cambodians face an insecure supply and pay some of the highest energy prices in the world. The impacts of this are widespread and may hinder economic development.
Biofuels may provide a substitute for diesel fuel that can be manufactured locally for a lower price, independent of the international oil price. The local production and use of biofuel also offers other benefits such as improved energy security, rural development opportunities and environmental benefits. The Jatropha curcas species appears to be a particularly suitable source of biofuel as it already grows commonly in Cambodia. Local sustainable production of biofuel in Cambodia, based on the Jatropha or other sources, offers good potential benefits for the investors, the economy, rural communities and the environment.
Sweet sorghum overcomes many of the shortcomings of other biofuel crops. With sweet sorghum, only the stalks are used for biofuel production, while the grain is saved for food or livestock feed. It is not in high demand in the global food market, and thus has little impact on food prices and food security. Sweet sorghum is grown on already-farmed drylands that are low in carbon storage capacity, so concerns about the clearing of rainforest do not apply. Sweet sorghum is easier and cheaper to grow than other biofuel crops in India and does not require irrigation, an important consideration in dry areas.
Public attitudes and the actions of stakeholders can play a crucial role in realising the potential of biofuels. Informed discussion and dialogue, based
both on the scientific case and an understanding of public and stakeholder views, is important.
The Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels is an international initiative which brings together farmers, companies, governments, non-governmental organizations, and scientists who are interested in the sustainability of biofuels production and distribution. During 2008, the Roundtable developed a series of principles and criteria for sustainable biofuels production through meetings, teleconferences, and online discussions.
The Roundtable for Sustainable Biofuels released “Version Zero” of its proposed standards for sustainable biofuels on August 13, 2008. This includes a dozen principles, each with several criteria developing the principle further. 
The Sustainable Biofuels Consensus is an international initiative which calls upon governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders to take concerted, collaborative and coordinated action to ensure the sustainable trade, use and production of biofuels. In this way biofuels may play a key role in the transformation of the energy sector, climate stabilization and resulting worldwide renaissance of rural areas, all of which are urgently needed.
The Sustainable Biofuels Consensus envisions a landscape that provides food, fodder, fiber, and energy, which offers opportunities for rural development; that diversifies energy supply, restores ecosystems, protects biodiversity, and sequesters carbon.
Biofuels offer the prospect of real market competition and oil price moderation. According to the Wall Street Journal, crude oil would be trading 15 per cent higher and gasoline would be as much as 25 per cent more expensive, if it were not for biofuels. A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes.
Biofuels have a limited ability to replace fossil fuels and should not be regarded as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. Biofuels on their own cannot deliver a sustainable transport system and so must be developed as part of an integrated approach,
which promotes other renewable energy options and energy efficiency, as well as moderating the overall demand and need for transport. The development of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, public transport, and better urban and rural planning all need to be considered.

Montreal Screwjob

The Montreal Screwjob is the real-life screwjob of then WWF superstar Bret Hart. The screwjob occurred in a match for the WWF Championship at "Survivor Series" in 1997 in Montreal, Quebec. The screwjob happened when Hart's opponent, Shawn Michaels, applied Hart's own finishing move, the Sharp Shooter and then WWF Referee Earl Hebner called for the bell under Vince McMahon's order even though Hart had not submitted (or tapped-out). As a result, Michaels became the WWF Champion. McMahon was the one who started the plans for the screwjob when Hart announced he was leaving the WWF for the companies then biggest competitor, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and refused to lose the title in front of his fellow Canadians to Michaels. The original, scripted plan was for Hart to win at Survivor Series and surrender the title the next night on "Raw". McMahon felt he did not need another "Alundra Blayze incident" so he instituted the screwjob. On the January 4, 2010 episode of Raw, he reconciled with Michaels by shaking his hand and hugging in the ring.

I think that we should incorporate Wikipedia: and WP: as one heading so if someone wrote WP to simplify, they wouldn't get lost. This is what en.wikipedia does. 04:15, 4 December 2008 (UTC)
"reset" Just thought i'd explain fully how this works. What it requires is for a developer to add some code to LocalSettings.php. This allows for WP: to become a "shortcut namespace" that relates to Wikipedia: without any redirecting. Things with WP: will automatically be in the Wikipedia: namespace. For it to work, everything with WP: will need to be deleted, and it also might be a while before it gets fulfilled. Personally, I think it's an undeeded measure here at Simple at the moment, but if there is consensus for it I will file a bug. 08:57, 11 December 2008 (UTC)
Support or oppose to making WP: a shortcut (not a seperate heading) of Wikipedia: (see above conversation).
The discussion has a consensus to do the change. The motion passes. () 14:53, 12 January 2009 (UTC)
If this turns out to be (currently support is leading more than 50%), can someone with the knowledge and the capability of making this bug do it? I don't really know how to code. 21:35, 22 December 2008 (UTC)
"reset" Hmmm if you can't be bothered the i'll get GBot2 to do it - it's a simple AWB job (I think...). Cheers, 23:05, 23 December 2008 (UTC)
"(reset)" We're straying a bit off topic. WE NEED MORE PEOPLE TO TAKE PART IN THIS VOTE! 19:39, 31 December 2008 (UTC)
Hello all, I do this in a section on its own, because the other two sections above are already getting lengthy. I'll keep it very short, because we already have had this discussion many times before. As was pointed out before, Wikipedia is not censored; this means that we do not adapt our content so it fits special audiences (like children). The proposal has been made to "moderate" Wikipedia in some ways, in that special tags should be introduced. These tags would specify that the content given is of the specified nature, e.g. that a certain article is for an audience "10+" because the article contains certain "features" that make it suitable for that audience. There are several problems with this:
In short, trying to "rate" articles probably raises more issues than it solves.-- () 18:14, 29 December 2008 (UTC)
Since I was the one who started this debate again, I will address some of the issues.
 () 18:05, 31 December 2008 (UTC)
First, sorry for accidently messing up your post.
What I am hearing is that since we can't prevent mischievous people from acting mischievous, we should not do anything. That would be like saying since we can't prevent all spam emails from entering our computer we should not setup any filter system. Anybody who uses wikipedia is going to have to accept the risks. One of those risks is that the articles are biased even though they are supposed to be NPOV. The second risk is that the content is just wrong. The founder of Wikipedia gets 10 emails a week from students who got an F on their paper for using Wikipedia as a main source. The third risk is that you will see or read something that you did not want to see or read. If a parent does not want to accept those risk to any level, they spend the $60/year and get a subscription to Britanica. I am leaning very strongly in that direction. The problem, as stated before, is that Wikipedia commons has a bunch of great pictures.
If a parent is willing to accept some risk, then having tags will help to organize the materials, and creating pages to more directly link to images that kids would use in school reports would improve this site, not harm it.
The sad part of this is that there are a lot of people who are putting in a lot of effort in this project. 95% of the people here, at least, have good intentions for being here. They want to share the knowledge that they have learned with others. Why do I have to prevent my child from reading articles about different animals, because I have personal issues with my child seeing the articles from the project sexuality before he has formally been introduced to that topic by either his parents or through his school?
I know of whole schools that do not allow the children to use the Internet for any school project. The kids must use traditional sources. There is one side of me that can see that point of view, especially reading this discussion. But there is another side of me that believes that there must be a middle ground. Do I really want to go from completely isolating my child to just letting my child loose during college? It seems extreme and very unhealthy.
FYI: I did not say "fix" by protecting a page. I said "fix" by the project leader, aka , monitoring the pages under his project and making sure that people don't remove the tags once they have been approved by the project committee.
As for what rating system to use, this site is out of American (USA), so the standards of ratings of similar materials out of the USA should be used. I did a bunch of research on different rating systems, and Marvel comic books seems to be most in line with what we are doing here (text and images). Plus, I think that their age breakups make sense, as well as the criteria for placing items into a category. On top of that, we can always add standard text to give more information to the potential reader.
Another option is to just use the categories that are used in Vista's parental controls since they have to do with web page content.
Age tags are the easiest to read. On the other hand, the text descriptions are usually useful for the in between stages. Do you allow your 12 yr old who had his first wet dream to read an article about "Ejaculation" that is rated 15+ or 13+? The 15+ one contains a live person video while the 13+ one contains only a diagram and some images of semen. It will depend on the child and the family values.
I just did some testing with Vista's parental controls and Simple Wikipedia's site. If a person activates "Parental Control" and sets the "Web Restrictions" to medium it will allow access to Simple Wikipedia. Page of the type "penis", "ejaculation", "nudity" will not be displayed without parental permission, but pages like "elephant" will display without a parent having to give permission. If the "Web Restrictions" are set to "High", the user cannot access anything on Simple Wikipedia.
I have not done testing on commons MediaWiki to find out how it interacts there.
Moderator question: If I did some testing, and I wrote an article "Vista Parental Controls and Wikipedia" would that be considered "Original research" and not allowed? () 00:44, 2 January 2009 (UTC)
Due to the fact that Microsoft Vista out of the box can handle the main parental control / censoring issues with their parental controls, this issue is now null and void and is formally closed. Thank you everyone who participated in this debate and discussion. I think that it has been educational for all involved. () 00:44, 2 January 2009 (UTC)
Hi, I just wanted to let other users know that if you desire to have your wikipedia filtered CYBERsitter for $40.00 works great for content filtering of wikipedia and other sites. You will need to add words to your custom filter list, but Gwib's Sexual Anatomy project provides a great foundation of filter words. But do go through it, because I did delete a couple of generic words, and added a couple that he was missing.
I have not tried it personally, but I think that if you add {http://www.britannica.com} it will not filter these words for Britannica. That means that you can filter out the sex education from Wikipedia, but still have it through Britannica. Need to do some more testing on this, but it is not a top priority of mine right now.
The high setting will block all wikipedia sites, and it works fine for preschoolers. Although I don't think that any preschoolers would be interested in wikipedia at any level.
The medium setting is a joke. It is worse than not having anything, because you think that you have filtering when you don't. There is no ability to add filter items. There is no rhyme or reason to Vista's filtering. Penis is filtered on simple wikipedia, but not on en wikipedia even when they both have the same categories. What is triggering the filtering? Who knows. It is Microsoft. What do you expect.
OpenDNS is a DNS server that allows filtering. All of the wikipedia sites are categorized as reference sites. So the only way that wikipedia sites will get filtered is by the user saying that all reference sites are filtered.
There are people who are recommending other filter categories, but I doubt that they will go through. IMO, wikipedia is in a class of its own. It is not a tradition reference site like Britannica that has an editorial board, but it is also not what some people are suggesting. It falls into a gray area that if somebody does not want to go to one extreme (complete blocking) or the other extreme (completely open) then you need specialized software that can take care of content filtering (see review of CYBERsitter above).
This is wikipedia's policy about implementing a rating system:
I propose that implementing a rating system on this wiki is a good idea, because it would allow filtering software (eg. NetNanny) a better ability to filter out content that some users may feel objectionable. Since there does not seem to be a standard for internet content, using the one published by the Software Rating Editorial Board seems like the best match. They break things up into "children"; "Everyone"; "10+"; "Teen"; "Mature"; "Adults only". This would solve the issue for everyone, because the adults can have their page and there can be a separate page for the students.
Okay, so does anybody have objections to me setting a up a new WikiProject named something along the lines of "Discovery Wiki" or "Student Wiki"? The goal would be to create a set of categories and pages that aimed at the 3-12 age range including content and images. The overall goal would be to allow parents to access useful wikipedia material that is age appropriate. If a regular page is appropriate, there will be a link to that page. If it is not, then a new page would be created and marked appropriately. I guess one could say it is reverse censoring. All material on this wiki will be assumed to be adult only content unless it is specifically noted otherwise. () 13:59, 26 December 2008 (UTC)
Okay, so the final consensus of the community is that it is not physically possible to create a version of wikipedia that can honestly meet the needs of Non-Native English speakers and children within the same wiki. Even if the reading level was not an issue, content would be an issue. Furtheremore, more than likely, there will need to be two children's versions of wikipedia: Children's Wikipedia and Student Wikipedia. I now will go back to wikipedia headquarters and relate to them to final vote of the community -- that a separate wiki is required for children. Thank you everyone for your feedback. Sorry for the confusion, and if an admin wants to delete the pages that I started related to this project, you are welcome to do so. They all begin with MFW.
I did not have any desire to affect this wiki, but I had to go through proper procedure. I had to present the issue to the community and have the community decide on the best course of action. () 00:16, 28 December 2008 (UTC)
I was just wondering why when you collapse the donation notice, it doesn't go away, but if you click on the expand button, it does. Why does this happen? 20:04, 26 December 2008 (UTC)

I think the deletion of this template should be brought before the community to properly discuss whether this template is too much, or just right for the job.

Hello all, i am tweaking archiving settings for the bot; I reduced "wait time" before archival from 14d to 7d. Is there a way to get the source code for the bot; I have a few ideas I want to implement, namely:
- dynamic settings: Its ok to wait 14 days before archiving if the size threshold is not reached; once it is reached though, it should be more important to archive; ie. a lower and upper lifetime on articles. In the meantime I hope drastically reduced article lifetimes will work.-- () 17:22, 29 December 2008 (UTC)

Its as easy as the header states. I'd like the flood flag here to prevent flooding (my flooding in particular, I know you've all seen it) when a Crat is not available to grant a bot flag. From what I understand, admins will be able to temporarily grant the flag, and remove it when the user or admin is done. Nuff said. 15:07, 29 December 2008 (UTC)
With only 40k articles here I don't know that the flooding ever gets bad enough for it to be an issue. That being said I know there are less people here to watch the new changes page so it could be a good thing. - () 15:09, 29 December 2008 (UTC)
"e/c" Note: It's called the Flood Flag, and the WMF recently offered it to all wikis. If there's consensus i'll file a bug ;). If you need me to explain more (Synergy's efforts are, tbh, pathetic :P ;) ) I will. 15:13, 29 December 2008 (UTC)
CM: Basically what Djsasso said. It removes mass edits from recent changes, so they can't be seen. It would be granted on a temporary basis for editing, and removed when you are finished. Admins would be willing to approve it (this also reduces the need for more crats) for short periods of time and it would be for anyone not wanting a bot account also (like me). 19:01, 29 December 2008 (UTC)
Some additional clarification: Admins may grant "themselves" (only) the flood flag & may remove it from "themselves" (only) - so you cannot grant it to anyone else, whether they are sysops or not. Additionally, bureaucrats may remove it (in case someone forgets to remove it, or is misusing it). Meta was the first wiki to use this configuration; is our explanatory page & it would work in the same way here. Thanks – . |  23:01, 29 December 2008 (UTC)

Hello everyone!
I saw a bug report on the Wikimedia Bugzilla, , and decided to do something about it. I have run a query on the toolserver database, and produced a list of wanted pages. However, the list is rather long, 14 megabytes in total (259953 wanted pages), and will probably make your web browser run pretty slowly. This data is out of date unfortunately, as it is an expensive query to run, and the server upon which I ran the query currently has it's database replication disabled, and is already over a week behind.
If you would like me to run the query again at some point, I'd be happy to run it, with a higher limit I think.
Quick comment about namespaces: you'll only see the number of the namespace, not the full title. Take a look at the bug link above to see a list of all the namespace <=> number mappings. If you want me to run this regularly, I'll come up with some way to automatically do that.
Once again, the list is here.

The ability to use the import function would allow an easier import, and better attribution. So trust can be established, permissions I currently hold include access to the WMF blog, and . I am asking for a consensus here, so the permission can be assigned at meta. Thank you for your consideration. () 04:59, 1 January 2009 (UTC)
One thing to note is that even if an article is deleted the attribution is kept, which is why we keep deleted articles. The attribution doesn't necessarily have to be visible to everyone to be valid. Atleast thats what en.wiki goes based on. I assume its the same for all WMF wikis. I also think the importers function has been shot down a number of times because people tend to import and not convert. - () 15:31, 1 January 2009 (UTC)

As you can we have a rather small help namespace. I was wondering if it would be ok if I had my bot copy all the help articles (which are public domain, so no licensing issues) over here(obviously it wouldn't copy if an article already existed here). Thoughts? ideas? -- 02:04, 4 January 2009 (UTC)
Do we really need on the plots of works of fiction on here? It seems that every book or film article has this, even for a two paragraph general description of the plot. See articles like Dead Calm or Goldfinger. They seem completely pointless. Our content disclaimer states flat out that Wikipedia does contain spoilers. Do we really need to "shield" people from the plots? Right now we have almost 150 articles with spoiler warnings, it appears, ranging from Harry Potter and Disney Movies to Lord of the Rings and The Wizard of Oz. () 03:52, 7 January 2009 (UTC)
I believe the spoilers have got to go. They're totally against the purpose of an encyclopedia. You don't want it spoiled? Don't go there. I can't believe this is even still an issue. · 18:22, 7 January 2009 (UTC)

Hello,
A number of pages, basically the Columbian Professional Football results from 1948 to 2008 were recently up for deletion; I have made a decision, and you are welcome to comment on it:
I know that this is rule is quite fuzzy, but I think it allows for both the sports addicts to cover their favorite result tables, and to the more encyclopedia-savy ones to not get too many pages consisting only of sports results.
Any comments (including founded criticism) welcome -- () 18:18, 9 January 2009 (UTC)
Hi there all. Ever since we have started writing Romanian River articles, we have been in a big struggle as there are quite a few rivers to write articles about. As the main writer of these articles, I would like to say to you all that I am proud to say that we have written 25% or a quarter of all the Romanian River articles that need writing. :). Cheers, 04:34, 30 December 2008 (UTC)
Only 25%? Dear god man... 04:49, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

Central Florida

Central Florida is the central region of the United States state of Florida, on the East Coast. The region enjoys a hot but stormy climate, with many thunderstorms, and hurricanes threatening often.
The exact boundary of the area may be in dispute. Central Florida tends to be thought of as the area around metropolitan Orlando, including Orange, Osceola, Seminole, Lake, Brevard, and Volusia counties. Polk, Flagler, and Sumter counties are considered by some, including the local media, to be part of Central Florida. Although geographically in the central part of the state, usually the west central coast, including Hillsborough, Pinellas, Pasco, and Hernando counties, is considered the Tampa Bay area or the Suncoast, rather than a part of Central Florida. This area is known as the I-4 corridor.
In 2007, the guessed total population of the Central Florida area was just over 3.8 million people. Central Florida is a mix of deep south and typical Floridian culture. This is what makes the area unique.
The largest cities in Central Florida are Orlando, Palm Bay, Lakeland, Melbourne, Deltona, Daytona Beach, Kissimmee, Altamonte Springs and Sanford. 
The region has grown over the last two decades. A lack of growth management has led to massive urban sprawl in the area. Outdated and unplanned building has led to an overload of vehicle traffic. Local governments, in dispute with each other over growth, have now started taking a more regional approach and several transportation programs.

Kanata, Ontario

Kanata is a large suburban area in the western part of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It has a population of 90,000 and is growing very fast. It is just west of the Greenbelt. It is an important area for Hi-tech Businesses. It was an independent town from 1978 to 2000. 
Kanata was originally part of the Township of March. It was settled by Europeans in the early 19th Century. It was mainly agricultural(Farms) until the 1960s when it became the site of a lot of construction. Modern Kanata is largely the creation of Bill Teron, a developer and urban planner who purchased over 3,000 acres (12 km2) of rural land and set about building a model community. It was planned to have a mix of offices, residential(Housing) area, and green area. Kanata was divided into a number of communities. Each was intended to have its own Business Center and unique culture. These include Beaverbrook, Glen Cairn, Bridlewood, Katimavik, Hazeldean, Morgan's Grant, and Kanata Lakes.
Kanata grew Rapidly. In 1978 the Province of Ontario made Kanata a city separate from the Township of March. Kanata remained a city intil 2001 when it was merged with the city of Ottawa, along with many other cities.
The city became an important hi-tech centre. DEC was one of the pioneer technology companies in Kanata. The DEC campus has been successively Digital, Compaq, and is now HP. Kanata remains home to many of the major hi-tech employers of Ottawa, such as Mitel, March Networks, Alcatel-Lucent, Dell Canada, Hewlett-Packard, Smart Technologies, Norpak, Nortel, MDS Nordion, Breconridge, AMCC, and Cisco Systems, Inc.. The hi-tech industry is clustered along March Road, in the Kanata North Business Park and Kanata Research Park, and along Eagleson Road, in the Kanata South Business Park.
Kanata is in the Ottawa Valley. It is about 22 km southwest of Downtown Ottawa. It is along the Highway 417. The northern end of Kanata is west of the Ottawa River.
To the east, Kanata is separated from the former City of Nepean by the National Capital Commission's Greenbelt (Ottawa). The community of Bells Corners borders the inner side of the Greenbelt. Bells Corners is, like Kanata, a hi-tech suburb that was established around 1950.
To the west of Kanata is Stittsville, Ontario. Stittsville first a farming community, then a village, then part of the township of Goulbourn. Stittsville is now a large suburb which was merged into the new City of Ottawa in 2001, and is largely employed by the hi-tech industry.
To the south of Kanata is the former village of Richmond, Ontario which pre-dated what is now the City of Ottawa.

Ramón y Cajal worked on thin slices of brain tissue which were laid on microscope slides and stained with silver. The stain was invented by Golgi, who shared the Nobel Prize with him.
Ramón y Cajal's investigations of the microscopic structure of the brain were original: he is considered by many to be the father of modern neuroscience. He was skilled at drawing, and hundreds of his illustrations of brain cells are still used for educational purposes today.

Mechnikov was a protozoologist who became better known for the discovery of macrophages in 1882. He discovered how they dealt with germs by phagocytosis. Macrophages are found in virtually all tissues, and patrol for potential pathogens by amoeboid movement.
He is also credited with coining the term gerontology in 1903, for the emerging study of ageing and longevity.

Ehrlich directed a research program which discovered the first treatment for syphilis which worked. It was a compound of arsenic which went by the trade name of "Salvarsan". He studied trypanosomiasis and other protozoal diseases. He produced trypan red, which was (as his Japanese assistant Shiga showed) effective against trypanosomes. 
He invented a staining system for bacteria (before Gram staining). He did a complete survey of all the cell staining techniques then known. He showed how to tell the difference between different kinds of white blood cells, and discovered mast cells. He discovered that methylene blue, which stains bacteria and cell nuclei, could put the malarial parasite, "Plasmodium", into recession (the fever drops).
He also made a decisive contribution to an antiserum against diphtheria, and developed a method for standardizing therapeutic serums. His co-worker got a sole Nobel Prize for the joint work on diphtheria.

Incarnation (Christianity)

The Incarnation is the Christian belief that Jesus Christ is the God of Israel in a human body. The word incarnate comes from Latin and means “in the flesh.” (in=in, carnis=flesh) The incarnation is a basic teaching of Christianity. It is based on the New Testament of the Holy Bible. The incarnation is the belief that Jesus, who is the non-created second person of the triune God; took on a human body and everything that is human and became both man and God. In the Bible its teaching is in the Gospel of John, where in chapter 1 verse 14 (abbreviated as “John 1:14”), it says “And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us,” 
In the Incarnation, normally defined, the divine nature of the Son was joined but not mixed with human nature in one divine Person, Jesus Christ, who was both "truly God and truly man". The Incarnation is commemorated and celebrated each year at the Feast of the Incarnation, which is better known as the Annunciation.
This is center to the traditional Christian faith held by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Catholic Churches, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church, the Anglican Communion, and most Protestants. Other views on the subject have been considered in the past, but all were rejected by mainstream Christian bodies. 
In recent past, another doctrine known as "Oneness" has gained credit amongst Pentecostal groups (see below), but has been rejected by other Christians.

Eureka Stockade

The Eureka Stockade is the name given to a rebellion by gold miners at Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. It took place at sunrise, on December 3, 1854. The miners refused to pay a licence fee to look for gold. The miners said that the money for the licence was a tax, and that if they had to pay tax then they should be represented in the parliament. Irish miner Peter Lalor became the leader of the miners. They built a fort, or stockade, on Bakery Hill above the gold diggings on the Eureka gold lead. They were attacked by the British Army. More than 30 people were killed. The battle went for 20 minutes
The miners made their own flag which was flown at the Eureka Stockade. The flag was torn down during the battle and taken away by one of the soldiers. It was given to the Ballarat Art Gallery in the 1890s. Pieces of the flag were sometimes given to important visitors to Ballarat. It is believed that Queen Elizabeth II has a small piece. In the 1973 the flag was restored and put on display at the Art Gallery. The display was opened by the Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam. The flag has been put on the Victorian Heritage Register and was named an icon by the National Trust in 2006. In August 2010, the Ballarat Art Gallery said that the flag needed further work to keep it safe. It was sent to South Australia to be restored at a cost of more than AU$100,000. The Gallery has built a new airtight case to hold the flag.
The flag has often been used as a symbol of rebellion. Trade unions used the flag in their marches. The Prime Minister, John Howard, banned the flag from being flown on building sites.
In 2008, the Football Federation of Australia tried to stop the flag from being flown by supporters of the soccer team, Melbourne Victory. They said it was against their rules for teams to use political symbols. People with the flag would be made to leave the football ground. 
Many nationalist groups have started to use the flag as a symbol. It was used during the racial riots at Cronulla, New South Wales. People are concerned that it will become a symbol of leaving people out, and not a symbol of Australian democracy.

<doc id="153022" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=153022" title="Sokka">
Sokka

Sokka is a fictional character and one of the main characters in Nickelodeon's animated television series "". The character was created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, and voiced by Jack DeSena. In the film version, "The Last Airbender", in which is his name is pronounced differently, the character is played by Jackson Rathbone.
In the show, 15-year-old Sokka is a warrior of the South Pole's , a race of people who can control water. He, along with his younger sister Katara, discovers an Airbender named Aang, the long-lost Avatar, and accompanies him on his mission to win the Fire Nation and bring peace to the world.
Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko said that Sokka was originally designed to be "much" more low-key, but when his comedian voice actor Jack DeSena came in and brought liveliness to his character, they began writing towards that strength. Much of Sokka's dialogue and actions are derived from improvisations and intentional exaggerations on DeSena's part that the writers chose to include within scripts.
As a result of his design, Sokka's character has come to serve as a source of comic relief during the series, often a victim of visual slapstick. He also is extremely sarcastic.
Sokka grew up in his village and trains the warriors of his village. Forced to mature quickly when his mother Kya was killed in a Fire Nation raid, he cultivated his warrior skills with a militant zeal, while his sister Katara did chores and practiced waterbending. When Sokka was thirteen, his father and the other village men left to help the Earth Kingdom to fight against the Fire Nation, leaving him and his sister to look after their tribe with their grandmother, Gran Gran. As the oldest male left in the South Pole, Sokka came to assume a semi-leadership role by the time he was sixteen, fiercely protecting the village from any possible outside threats while trying to train children to be a new generation of defenders.
While on an expedition, Katara and Sokka discovered Aang inside an iceberg with Appa. After Katara freed him, Sokka initially believed that the Aang might be a Fire Navy spy, and he eventually grew xenophobic enough to banish him from the village. Upon discovering that Aang was the Avatar, destined to master all four elements and bring peace to the world, Sokka relented, realizing that they had a common enemy in the Fire Nation. He then set off with Katara and Aang on their journey to find a waterbending master at the North Pole, determined to hone his warrior skills by way of fighting Firebenders along the way. Fire Nation general Zhao killed Tui (the moon spirit) causing the moon to turn red and then vanish as during a lunar eclipse, thus preventing the waterbenders from using waterbending. Princess Yue (one of Sokka's love interests, the other being Kyoshi warrior Suki) then becomes the new moon by giving her life energy to the moon spirit, thereby restoring the moon in the sky and the abilities of the waterbenders.
In "Sokka's Master" (the 4th episode of ) Sokka expresses self-doubt that he is not as useful to the group as his companions. Inspired by his friends' encouragement, he seeks out a master to learn the sword. Rather than fighting with brute force and flawless technique, Sokka's creativity and heterodox approach to things are the cornerstones of his technique, and his master claims that in time Sokka will be a superior swordsman. As he departs, his master gives him a game piece that was previously established as a sign of connection to the secret society known as the Order of the White Lotus.
In the two-hour , Sokka and Katara meet with Katara's Waterbending master, Pakku, who has now married their grandmother. In the battle against Ozai, Sokka, his girlfriend Suki, and Toph destroyed a Fire Nation airship and use it to destroy others of its kind while Aang duels with the Phoenix King (Ozai). Sokka and Toph are separated from Suki and attack another airship, but Sokka breaks his leg and strains his arm grabbing hold of Toph, who was falling off the ship. In a compromised position, the pair are attacked by two soldiers, whom Sokka defeats at the cost of his sword and boomerang. As he and Toph are on the edge of the crashing ship, Suki arrives with another airship and saves the two. With the battle over, the trio reunite with Aang and the vanquished Phoenix King. At Zuko's coronation, Suki is reunited with her fellow Kyoshi Warriors, Sokka and Katara are reunited with their father, with the rest of the group reunited with their friends. In the end, Sokka is seen at Iroh's tea shop in Ba Sing Se where everyone teases a painted picture he created of the entire team, wherein he altered some factual details to make the scene more "memorable".
In the live-action movie The Last Airbender by M. Night Shyamalan, Sokka is played by Jackson Rathbone. His name is pronounced "So-kah," but in the show it's name pronounced "Sah-kah". Several important changes to the character's personality were made. In the film he is no longer the comic relief, nor does he exhibit any inventive abilities or usefulness in battle. He rarely shares screen time with Aang, the main hero, or contributes in any way to the plot. M. Night Shyamalan has said in an interview that these decisions were made in order to "ground" the character.

Structural engineering

Structural engineering is a subset of civil engineering dealing with the design and analysis of buildings and large non-building structures to withstand both the gravity and wind loads as well as natural disasters. Besides, it may also cover design of machinery, medical equipment, vehicles or any other objects where structural functionality or safety are involved. Structural engineers must ensure their designs satisfy building codes.
Major structural engineering projects go through the following four stages: "research", "design", "testing", and "construction" which are featured with the images below:
Structural engineering came to existence when the humans first started to construct their own structures. It became a more defined profession with the emergence of the architecture profession during the industrial revolution in the late 19th Century.
Entry-level structural engineers may design individual structural elements of a structure, for example, beams, columns, and floors of a building. More experienced engineers would be responsible for the structural design and integrity of an entire system, such as a building.
Structural engineers often specialize in particular fields, such as bridge engineering, building engineering, pipeline engineering, industrial structures, or special mechanical structures such as vehicles or aircrafts.

Leeds railway station

Leeds railway station or Leeds City Station is one of the largest railway stations in the United Kingdom. The station is the largest one in Leeds as well as being the main public transport facility in West Yorkshire. There is no larger railway interchange in Yorkshire or North East England.
The station is one of 17 in Great Britain to be managed by Network Rail. It is the busiest English station outside London, and the UK's second busiest station outside London after Glasgow Central.
Leeds City Station was built as Leeds New Station, to operate alongside Leeds Central Station (which has since closed). Leeds City Station was rebuilt twice, once in 1963 and again in 2002. Automatic ticket barriers were installed in 2008 replacing manned ticket booths.
There are plans to build a entrance to the station from the South side. This would let passengers leave with a short walk to Bridgewater Place and Granary Wharf at the moment they have to walk from the North Side and under the station in a tunnel. As part of High Speed 2 a new station is planned to the south called Leeds New Lane railway station, this will be linked to the current railway station by a bridge. Because of the number of trains now using Leeds railway station new platforms have been proposed.
The railway station has services to London, Sheffield, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Birmingham, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Kingston upon Hull and Scarborough. There are also many local services to Wakefield, Bradford, Huddersfield, Halifax, York, Harrogate and other local towns and cities.

Lemming

Lemmings are small rodents, usually found in or near the Arctic, in tundra biomes.
The lemmings and voles are the rats and mice of the Arctic. The lemmings have very short tails. They live underground in summer. Because the top soil freezes in the winter, they cannot burrow underground then, so they live under the snow during the colder months. They eat plants and roots. If they find plenty of food, they will have extra large families that year.
In a year with plenty of food, millions of lemmings will be roaming the tundra. The owls and foxes have more food than they can eat. They will have extra babies in they years when there are so many lemmings. However, the tundra does not have enough food for millions of lemmings. They rush across the tundra looking for food, and are eaten by predators or starve to death.
Many lemmings leave to find a new home, when they run out of food and space. Soon, millions of lemmings decide to follow the crowd. They go across the Arctic as a huge mass. Foxes and owls kill many of them. Some drown when trying to swim across rivers. It is often said that they fall off cliffs or even commit mass suicide, but that is an urban legend created by a Disney documentary ("White Wilderness", 1958) in which someone actually pushed the lemmings over the edge.
The lemmings that are left have enough food and space to survive. Then they start to breed and multiply again.
