Bayeux

Bayeux is a commune. It is found in the region Basse-Normandie in the Calvados department in the Northwest of France.
The town is famous for its tapestry. It is one of the oldest complete tapestries in the world.
The inhabitants are called "Bajocasses" ou "Bayeusains". Bayeux is a "sous-préfecture" of the Calvados department.
Bayeux is the capital of "the Bessin" which was called Bajocasses before. Bessin was a province of France before the French Revolution. The name of the city comes from the Celtic tribe which lived in the Bajocasses region.
The Vikings distroyed the town in 890, but it was rebuilt by Bothon at the beginning of the 10th century. The bishop Hugues II, and his successor, Odon de Conteville (Guillaume le Conquérant's half brother) insisted the town needed a new cathedral. In 1077, a new one was built. However it is around that time that the town lost a lot of influence. Guillaume le Conquérant decided to make Caen his capital, in 1050. The Bayeux Tapestry was made around that time
The Renaissance didn't really mark the town. The most notable building from that period is the Saint-Patrice Church. It was built between 1544 and 1548.
Bayeux was the first city in France to be liberated after the Battle of Normandy. On 16 June 1944, General Charles de Gaulle made his first major speech in Bayeux. The buildings weren't damaged much during the Battle of Normandy as the German forces were defending Caen at the same time.
The Bayeux War Cemetery is the largest British cemetery dating from the Second World War in France. There are 4648 graves: 3935 are British and 466 are German.
Bayeux is seven kilometres from the English Channel and the D-Day Landing Beaches. It is about 30 kilometres northwest of Caen. The town's elevation varies from 32 to 67 metres (with an average of 46 metres). The river Aure passes through it. 
The table below gives the temperatures and precipitation for 2007 (Recorded at the "station Caen-Carpiquet") :
The table below gives the minimum and maximum temperatures for each month :
La Bayeux Train station is on the "Paris-Saint-Lazare>Cherbourg" line. The TER line is from Caen to Rennes.
The "Bybus" goes around the town and to the communes of Saint-Martin-des-Entrées and Saint-Vigor-le-Grand. There is one main line ("Chojnice / St-Martin-des-Entrées") and three minor one's toward the different districts. The "Bus verts" invented by the "Conseil général" is a way to get to the surrounding communes (lines 30, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74). 3000 parking spaces in the town center make it an easy place to park. Furthermore, most car parks are free. The "By-pass" is Bayeux's ring road. The first part was built after the Battle of Normandy by British soldiers. The roads in the town center were too narrow for the Tanks to get through. The "By-pass" used to be the "Route nationale 13" until a motorway was built (A13 autoroute). 
The closest airport is in Caen (21 km away) and the closest ferry to England (32 km away) leaves in Ouistreham.
Bayeux is the fourth biggest town in Calvados by population. The three biggest are Caen, Hérouville-Saint-Clair and Lisieux.

SR Class 4DD

Conceived by Oliver Bulleid for the Southern Railway's Dartford commuter route, the two 4DD electric multiple units were the only double-deck trains to run on the main line railway network in Britain. The upper-level seats were squeezed in between the lower-level seats to ensure that the overall height of the unit was within the clearances necessary to pass through tunnels and under bridges. The 4DD was somewhat unsuccessful because the upper level compartments were cramped and poorly ventilated (the upper level windows could not be opened due to tight clearance). The compartments were pressure-ventilated but the equipment proved to be troublesome. Also dwell times at stations were increased because of the increased number of passengers per door. To obtain the extra seating capacity that was being sought, it was instead decided to lengthen trains from eight cars to ten.

Network SouthEast

Network SouthEast (NSE) was one of three passenger sectors of British Rail created in 1982. NSE principally operated commuter trains in the London area and inter-urban services in densely populated South East England. Before 1986, the sector was known as London & South Eastern.
After privatisation, NSE was divided up into several franchises:

British Rail Mark 3

British Rail's third fundamental design of carriage was designated Mark 3, and was introduced in 1976 primarily for use on the High Speed Train (HST). The coaches were also used as conventional loco-hauled stock as part of the West Coast Main Line (WCML) northern electrification scheme in the mid 1970s, designated Mark 3A and 3B. The final batch was built in 1988, but Mark 3-based multiple units continued to be built until the early 1990s.

<doc id="159694" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=159694" title="Desiro">
Desiro

Desiro is the brand name for a design of modular train manufactured by Siemens of Germany.
The Desiro can be made as a diesel or electric multiple unit (DMU or EMU). It is normally made as two and three-car trainsets. Although there are many differences between single trains, the basic body design is the same. These trains are mostly used for regional services, and belong to a new generation of light, modular trains which have become common in many Europen countries. They are sometimes thought as light regional railcars. They are mostly cheap to make and work. Their fast acceleration makes them good for services with short intervals between stations. However, they are sometimes complained by people for their poor passenger comfort.
In Austria, the ÖBB (Austrian Federal Railways) is right now using about 60 diesel-powered Desiro trains called "ÖBB 5022". These are based on the Class 642 used by Deutsche Bahn, but have added more safety stuff.
In 2005 and 2006, in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian State Railways begin working Desiro trains as part of a €67-million deal with Siemens AG for a total of 25 Diesel multiple units. As of 22 March 2006, 16 trains had been delivered, with many of them working on the Sofia-Kyustendil-Sofia line. Another €117-million deal for 25 EMUs has also been signed with Siemens AG. The EMUs were fitted out in Varna, where BDZ and Siemens AG are thinking about making a joint venture company. The EMUs are classes 30 and 31 and are servicing traffic in the Sofia and Plovdiv areas.
In Denmark, DSB rented 12 Desiro trains since 2002. The train is mostly used between Odense and Svendborg and between Odense and Fredericia. On July 2, 2009 DSB signed a contract of eight trains from Siemens for Grenaabanen for delivery late 2010. Nordjyske Jernbaner used Desiro trains since 2004 on all its working rails. Today the company owns eight Desiro trains.
 Germany's Deutsche Bahn first showed two-car Desiro DMUs for local services in 2000. With a top speed of 120 km/h, these "Class 642" units are mostly used on branch lines and regional lines. Besides the 234 units bought by DB until 2007, many private German rail companies are also using Desiro DMUs.
The "Class 642" has two MAN diesel engines with an output of 275 or 315 kW each and hydro-mechanical transmission with retarders. It normally has 100 seats. When linked together with Scharfenberg couplers, up to three trainsets can be worked together. The Desiros are quite popular with most passengers, thanks to their good acceleration. Because they have often replaced push/pull trains, their shorter journey times, such as on the "Müglitzbahn", have made greater passenger numbers.
At first, DB was going to work together modern DMUs bought from different makers, but because of software trouble, this proved to be impossible. Therefore the "Class 642" can only be mechanically coupled with other DMUs like the "Class 643".
Right now in Hungary, 31 diesel Desiros are in service with MÁV (counting 8 units from Greece), mostly as trains on the secondary line between Budapest-Esztergom and Budapest - Lajosmizse and as an InterCity between Budapest and Baja. On weekends, the units also used as top inter-city trains from Budapest to Baja and Sátoraljaújhely and as fast trains from Budapest to Tapolca. During the summer months (when fewer units are used on the Budapest suburban routes) Desiros appear on some local train diagrams on the norther shore of the Lake Balaton.
The 57km KLIA Ekspres and KLIA Transit airport rail link uses the Desiro ET 425 M four-car Electric Multiple Units. There are 12 trainsets right now working in Malaysia. 
These EMUs have a maximum commercial speed of 160 km/h.
Caile Ferate Romane (CFR), Romania's national railway worker, is one of the largest users of the Siemens Desiro trainsets. CFR, which is right now undergoing modernisation, has bought many Desiro trainsets and uses them for all types of train: ""Regio", "InterRegio" and "InterCity" inter-city services, but mostly on its "InterRegio"" express trains. There was some of the use of Desiros for CFR's long-distance services because they were thought to be uncomfortable. CFR has recently refitted them, and is now using Desiros mostly on its medium and short-distance routes.
In December 2009 Russian Railways ordered 38 Desiros for delivery in 2013 for use during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, with an option for a further 16 which would be mostly made in Russia.
Slovenian Railways works electric Desiro units that are made as DESIRO EMG 312 SR 31E. They are used as commuter stopping trains mostly on connections to and between Ljubljana and Maribor on the following lines:
SBB-CFF-FFS works double-decker (bilevel cars) EMU's. They are as class SBB RABe 514. They are used as commuter trains in Zürich, where 61 four-car sets have been working since 2006.
Nine 25 kV AC Desiro UK EMUs based on the Heathrow Connect Class 360/2 will be used for the Suvarnabhumi Airport Link which is right now under running test from the locomotive shop in Asoke to Suvarnabhumi Station under the airport.

Electrostar

Electrostar is the name given to a series of related electric multiple-unit passenger trains manufactured by Bombardier Transportation, formerly ADtranz. Since the privatisation of British Rail, it has become the most common new EMU type in Britain, where different variants referred to as Class 357, Class 375, Class 376, and Class 377 are most common on the high-volume commuter routes in South London and to the Sussex, Kent & South Essex coasts. It shares the same bodyshell and core structure as the Turbostar, which is in turn the most common post-privatisation diesel multiple unit family. Most of the Electrostar fleet were assembled at Bombardier’s Derby works.

Houlgate is a small tourist resort in northwestern France along the English Channel with a beach and a casino. It is a commune in the Calvados department in the Basse-Normandie region. 
It began as a hamlet in the commune of Beuzeval which was a very old parish and was part of the fiefdom of the Aché (or Achey). There were many different lords because several different families inherited the title through marriage, until gradually the land of the Beuzeval was sold to farmers. The parish was eventually controlled by Houlgate. On the south side of the river Drochon, between 1845 and 1850, sea bathing attracted summer visitors.
Houlgate is located along the English Channel in the valley of the Drochon. The valley is mostly built up or used for animal grazing. The town's area is 4.69 km² and the average altitude 5 m. Despite its low average height, the town contains two hills which form the natural limits of the commune.

<doc id="160194" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=160194" title="Cuckoo">
Cuckoo

The cuckoos are a family of near-passerine birds. They are the main part of the order called Cuculiformes. The family is famous for its "nest-parasite" members, but has a range of other types of bird. The cuckoo family, in addition to those species named as such, also includes the roadrunners, koels, malkohas, couas, coucals and anis. 
The family is notable for its subfamily, the Cuculinae. Many of them have a unique kind of parasitism called brood parasitism. This means it lays its eggs in the nests of other kinds of birds, who then rear the baby cuckoo instead of their own.
The common cuckoo, "Cuculus canorus", (usually just called “cuckoo” in countries where it lives) is a spring migrant to Europe and northern Asia. It winters in Africa and southern Asia. It is a greyish bird with a slender body, long tail and strong legs. It looks a little bit like a small bird of prey when it flies. The male is dark grey above with a blackish brown tail, spotted and tipped with white and unevenly barred in black. The female is similar but a bit more reddish on the upper breast. It likes to eat hairy caterpillars. It is often found where woods border on to open land.
The cuckoo gets its names because the male Common Cuckoo sings two notes which sound like the word “cu – ckoo”. The female does not make this sound. She has a loud bubbling call. 
The common cuckoo does not make a nest of its own, and they do not bring up their own young. Instead, the female lays her eggs in the nests of other birds. Each female cuckoo specialises in just one host species, and lays camouflaged eggs in that bird's nest. For example, a cuckoo which lays its eggs in reed warbler nests will lay eggs that look like those of a reed warbler.
The female cuckoo spends a lot of time watching the birds at the nest where she wants to lay an egg. She has to work out the exact time to go and lay her egg while the 'host' parents are not looking. If the cuckoo lays her egg in the nest before the other bird lays, the reed warbler will notice and knows it is not her egg, and so she will get rid of it. If the cuckoo lays her egg too late, when the reed warbler has finished laying, this will be noticed, too.
When the female cuckoo thinks it is the right moment she will fly down to the reed warblers' nest, pushes one reed warbler egg out of the nest, lays her egg and flies off. This only takes about 10 seconds. The reed warbler does not notice, and carries on looking after the eggs. When the cuckoo chick hatches it soon grows very fast. It pushes the other eggs or reed warbler chicks out of the nest. At 14 days old, it is about 3 times the size of the adult reed warblers. The chick has a huge mouth which it opens very wide. It also makes a very fast “cheeping” sound which sounds like a nest full of reed warbler chicks. This makes the parents behave as if they had a nest full of their own chicks.
About 56 of the Old World and 3 of the New World cuckoo species are brood parasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other birds. These species are obligate brood parasites, meaning that "they only reproduce in this fashion". The shells of the eggs of brood-parasites is thick. They have two distinct layers with an outer chalky layer that is believed to provide resistance to cracking when the eggs are dropped in the host nest. 
Female parasitic cuckoos specialize and lay eggs which look like the eggs of their chosen host. This has been produced by natural selection, as some birds are able to distinguish cuckoo eggs from their own, leading to those eggs least like the host's being thrown out of the nest. 
Host species may take direct action to stop cuckoos laying eggs in their nest. Birds whose nests are at high risk of cuckoo-eggs often mob cuckoos and drive them out of the area. 
Parasitic cuckoos are grouped into gentes: each gens specializes in a particular host species. This permits each gens to evolve a particular egg colouring. Thus, the species as a whole parasitizes a wide variety of hosts, but "each line of females specializes in a single host species". 
Genes regulating egg colour are passed down only along the maternal line, no doubt on the sex chromosome. This allows females to lay mimetic eggs in the nest of their host species. 
Females are thought to imprint on the host species which raised them; later they only parasitize nests of that species. Male cuckoos fertilize females of all lines, so gene flow takes place between the different maternal lines.
The detail and near-perfection of the cuckoo nest parasitism, and the defences of the host birds, are extraordinary. Many of the host species can spot and throw out almost perfect cuckoo eggs. This system is a fine example of an evolutionary arms race, a type of co-evolution. There are other birds which practise nest parasitism (such as the cowbirds) but these other systems are much less specialized.
The males and grey females in flight look a bit like a sparrowhawk. That may protect them from other birds' mobbing (Batesian mimicry). The advantage of the rufous-coloured females is not known. It may be that, being less common, they are less recognised by other bird species.
The cuckoo only stays in its summer location for about 10 weeks. In Britain, for example, it arrives in April and the adults start for Africa by the end of June or early July. They arrive in Africa (or Asia) in August.
They moult twice a year, changing feathers partially in summer, and completely in winter.

Southern Railway (Great Britain)

The Southern Railway (SR), was a British railway company established in the 1923 Grouping. It contained notable examples of civil engineering, linking London with the Channel ports, South West England and Kent. The railway was formed by the amalgamation of smaller companies, the largest of which were the London & South Western Railway, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, and the South Eastern and Chatham Railway. Construction of what was to become the Southern began in 1838 with the opening of the London and Southampton Railway, which was renamed the London & South Western Railway.

List of British Rail modern traction locomotive classes

This page lists every locomotive allocated a TOPS classification and all modern traction (e.g. diesel, electric, gas turbine, petrol) stock used on the mainline network since 1948 (i.e. British Railways and post-privatisation).
The 1955 diesel locomotive classes are given in brackets where applicable.
A large number of different shunter types were purchased by British Rail and its predecessors, many of which were withdrawn prior to the introduction of TOPS. The tables below attempt to list the different types and the different classifications used to describe them as clearly as possible:
Shunter classes are listed by 1955 class, which puts TOPS classes in ascending order, and generally puts 1948 and 1962 classes in ascending order. Unclassed shunters are placed at the start of the table; TOPS class 07 has been placed so its 1962 class is in the logical place.
Locomotive class are listed by TOPS class. Locomotives for TOPS classes 24 and 26 have their original sub-classes shown, as each wholly comprised locomotives from a distinct 1962 class.
When British Rail implemented the TOPS system for managing their operating stock, part of their shipping fleet was incorporated into the system as Class 99, in order to circumvent some of the restrictions of the application software.
These were locomotives built and owned by private firms, but used by British Rail to test them.
A number of TOPS class numbers were allocated to proposed locomotives, both diesel and electric, which for many reasons were not proceeded with.

List of British Rail electric multiple unit classes

This page lists every electric-powered multiple unit allocated a TOPS classification or used on the mainline network since 1948 (i.e. British Railways and post-privatisation). British Rail operated a wide variety of electric multiple units for use on electrified lines.
These use electrical switching devices (thyristors and transistors) and have electronic power control.
The Southern Railway and its successor, the Southern Region of British Rail, used three letter codes to classify their DC EMU fleets, as shown after the TOPS class numbers.
The 500 series classes were reserved for DC (third/fourth rail) EMUs not from the Southern Region. This included the DC (third/fourth rail) lines in North London, Merseyside and Greater Manchester. The DC electric network around Tyneside had been de-electrified by the time TOPS was introduced, and the stock withdrawn or transferred to the Southern Region.

The 900 series classes were reserved for multiple units in departmental stock, most of which were converted from old passenger units. In broad terms, classes 930-935 were allocated to Southern Region multiple units (ex-200 and 400 series), 936 & 937 to other EMUs (ex-300 and 500 series) and 960 to other DMUs (ex-100 series). In recent years, this has been less rigidly adhered to.

While DP2 looked like a Class 55 locomotive in outline, there were many detail differences; particularly the large bodyside radiator vents at one end, and the single roof fan as opposed to the four symmetrically placed fans on the Deltics. These differences were the external effect of DP2 being totally different from the twin-engined Deltics internally, being the forerunner of the Class 50.

The Southern Railway numbered its departmental (non-revenue earning) stock, both locomotives and carriages in a series commencing at 1S. The series was retained by the Southern Region of British Rail, but amended so that the numbers carried a 'DS' prefix instead of an 'S' suffix. This page lists the locomotives numbered in this series, including steam, diesel and electric locomotives.

Southampton Corporation Tramways 45

Southampton Corporation Tramways No. 45, or Southampton 45, is an open-top tramcar. It was built in 1903 by Hurst Nelson. At first it had a three window saloon, before being rebuilt by Southampton Corporation Tramways with a four window one. The tram looks out of proportion as it had to pass through the very low Bathgate Arch in the centre of Southampton. A normal sized tram would not have been able to have passed underneath the arch.
The tramcar operated from 1903 until the Southampton system closed in 1949. At an enthusiasts' tour of the system the Museum Committee of the Light Railway Transport League bought the tram for £10. This price included a refurbished truck and a full repaint. This act began the entire preservation movement of British tramways.
After it had been purchased the tram travelled the country as there was not yet a museum set up that could store the tram. By 1955 the tram was being stored at Marton depot in Blackpool. It was soon given to the Tramway Museum Society (TMS) and moved to the National Motor Museum at Beaulieu, Hampshire. It was placed next to Newcastle 102, another preserved tramcar. Both of the trams were in an open-air display.
The tram moved to Crich Tramway Village in October 1960, and has been there ever since. It is in regular use during the summer months and is the museum's only operational open-top tramcar.

Acanthocephala

The Acanthocephala (Greek "akanthos", thorn + "kephale", head) are a group of parasitic worms. They may be called known as "acanthocephales", "thorny-headed worms", or "spiny-headed worms". They have an evertable proboscis, armed with spines, which they use to pierce and hold the gut wall of the host. Acanthocephalans have no gut and absorb nutrients directly from the host’s gut. 
Acanthocephalans have complex life cycles, with various hosts, including invertebrates, fishes, amphibians, birds, and mammals. The juveniles are parasitic in crustaceans and insects. Adults live in the digestive tract of vertebrates, especially fish. About 1150 species have been described.
The Acanthocephala were thought to be a separate phylum. Recent genome analysis has shown that they are closely related to rotifers. Since all parasites are derived from free-living forms, the Acanthocephalans are modified rotifers. This is an example of molecular phylogenetics. In due course, spiny-headed worms will probably be placed in a taxonomic rank below phylum, such as sub-phylum or class.

<doc id="160603" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=160603" title="Bumblebee bat">
Bumblebee bat

The bumblebee bat ("Craseonycteris thonglongyai"), also known as Kitti's hog-nosed bat, is an endangered species of bat. It is the only member of the family Craseonycteridae. It occurs in western Thailand and southeast Burma. It usually lives in limestone caves along rivers.
This is the smallest species of bat and one of the world's smallest mammals. It has a reddish-brown or grey coat, with a distinctive pig-like snout. Colonies vary in size, with an average of 100 individuals per cave. The bat feeds during short activity periods in the evening and dawn, foraging around nearby forest areas for insects. Female bat have only one offspring each year.
The bumblebee bat is about 29–33 millimetres (1.14–1.30 in) in length and 2 grams (0.07 oz) in mass). This is the reason for its common name "bumblebee bat". It is the smallest species of bat. The Etruscan shrew is lighter (1.2–2.7 g) (0.042-0.095 oz).
The bat has a distinctive swollen, pig-like snout with thin, vertical nostrils. Its ears are relatively large, while its eyes are small and mostly concealed by fur. Its teeth are typical of an insectivorous bat.
The wings are relatively large and darker in colour, with long tips that allow the bat to hover. Kitti's Hog-nosed Bat has no visible tail. There is a large web of skin between the hind legs which may help in flying and catching insects, although there are no tail bones to help control it in flight.
In Thailand, the bat is in a small region of Kanchanaburi Province, in the drainage basin of the Khwae Noi River.
Since the 2001 discovery of a single individual in Burma, at least nine separate sites have been identified. The Thai and Burmese populations are morphologically identical, but their echolocation calls are distinct. It is not known whether the two populations are reproductively isolated.
The bumblebee bat roosts in the caves of limestone hills, along rivers, within dry evergreen or deciduous forests. While many caves contain only 10 to 15 individuals, the average group size is 100, with a maximum of about 500. Individuals roost high on walls or roof domes, far apart from each other. Bats also undertake seasonal migration between caves.
The bat has a brief activity period, leaving its roost for only 30 minutes in the evening and 20 minutes at dawn. These short flights are easily interrupted by heavy rain or cold temperatures. During this period, the bat forages within fields of cassava and kapok or around the tops of bamboo clumps and teak trees, within one kilometre of the roosting site. The wings seem to be shaped for hovering flight, and the gut contents of specimens do include spiders and insects that are presumably gleaned off foliage. Nevertheless, most prey is probably caught in flight. Main staples of the bat's diet include small flies.
Late in the dry season (around April) of each year, females give birth to a single offspring. During feeding periods, the young either stays in the roost or remains attached to the mother at one of her two vestigial pubic nipples.
The bumblebee bat was discovered in 1974. It is the only living species in the family Craseonycteridae.
As of the species' most recent review in 1996, the bat is listed by the IUCN as endangered, with a downward population trend.
Currently, the most significant and long-term threat to the Thai population could be the annual burning of forest areas, which is most prevalent during the bat's breeding season. In addition, the proposed construction of a pipeline from Burma to Thailand may have a negative impact. Threats to the Burmese population are not well known.
In 2007, the bat was identified by the EDGE project (evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered) as one of its top 10 "focal species".

Ballan, Victoria

Ballan is a small town in Victoria, Australia. It is a part of the Shire of Moorabool. Ballan is north west of Melbourne, on the Werribee River. In 2006 there were 1808 people living in Ballan. The Western Freeway goes past the town.
The first people to live in the Ballan area were the Aborigines, the Wautharong people. The area was rich in animals with kangaroos, kangaroo rats, bandicoots, dingos, and two sorts of native cat. Many of these animals had gone by the end of the 1800s, with Europen settlement. 
The first European settlers came from Tasmania, landing near Geelong, Victoria, and working their way up the Moorabool River with their sheep flocks. Robert Von Steiglitz first came to the area in 1838. He named it after Ballan in Ireland. Other early settler names included Covvie, Stead, Wallace and Egerton. 
There were fights between the Wautharong people and white farmers during settlement. Robert Von Steiglitz said stated in his diary:
... it may be questioned by some feather-bed philanthropist whether we had the right to take the country from the blacks but I believe the general rule is that if people cultivate or graze the land they have a claim to it. These creatures did neither ...
Gold was found in the area in 1851. A lot of people came to look for gold. This was part of the Victorian Gold Rush. The Ballan Hotel dates from the gold rush period in 1851. The town was an important staging point for coaches going to the Ballarat goldfields. The Post Office opened in September 1853 although there were two earlier offices in the area named Ballan. 
Ballan’s first primary school started on 8 January 1855. 
The first Mechanics' Institute in Ballan was built in 1861. The current Mechanics' Institute built on land bought in 1881. The facade (front) of the building was taken down and rebuilt in 1922. The building houses the library for the town town and a hall. 
St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church in Ballan was opened in July 1866. 
On 15 November 2003 a Sprinter train going to Ballarat was derailed (came off the tracks) between Ballan and Gordon hurting 61 people when it crashed into a car on a country railway crossing.
The town has an Australian Rules Football team playing in the Central Highlands Football League.
It also has two senior and three junior cricket teams in the Ballarat Cricket Association.

Metrovick holds a place in history as the builders of the first commercial transistor computer, the Metrovick 950, and the first British axial-flow jet engine, the Metrovick F.2. Their factory in Trafford Park, Manchester, was for most of the 20th century one of the biggest and most important heavy engineering facilities in Britain and the world.

British Rail Class 99

The British Rail Class 99 was a fleet of 14 ferries, mostly owned by Sealink, which carried rail vehicles between Britain and mainland Europe. When British Rail implemented the TOPS system for managing their operating stock, these ships were incorporated into the system in order to circumvent some of the restrictions of the application software. This allowed them to be counted as locomotives while carrying railway vehicles in the same way as a normal locomotive would haul a train.

Ephesus

Ephesus (; ) was an ancient Greek city on the west coast of Anatolia, now in Turkey. It was one of the twelve cities of the Ionian League. The Apostle Paul is said to have addressed an epistle to the Christians of the city., and it is now known as the Epistle to the Ephesians in the New Testament. The site still possesses many well preserved Roman ruins side by side with rich history. 
Most significant are the odeon, used as a concert hall and city council with the capacity of 1.500 people, Temple of Hadrian dating back to the second century where one of the best sculpture craftsmanship can be seen, Curettes Street hosting many monuments and countless colums on the sides of its marble paved ground, a fountain dedicated to Emperor Trajan where a part of a remaining statue shows us that Romans knew the round shape of the world in the first century AD, and latrines (toilets) where it can be seen how they cared about public sanity. 
Two other of Ephesus's outstanding monuments hold importance not just for their home city also for world's cultural and architectural heritage. The first one is the library of Celsus which is located at the end of the Curettes Street. The library looks like a two storeyed building seen from the facade but as we know it former had three stories inside. The facade shows a rare found craftsmanship. Also the library was the third biggest library of the ancient world, after the libraries of Alexandria and Pergamon. Anyone who stands in front of this monumental building can understand why did it take twenty years (115 AD to 135 AD) to complete it. 
The second one is Ephesus' grand theatre which had the capacity of 25.000 spectators. It was not just a place of art also as we know it was used for animal and gladiator fights. With its great dimensions it makes one think about how small my moment in time really is. It's one of the sacred ruins of Ephesus, according to the Acts of the Apostles (19:23-41), the theater was the site of the "riot of the silversmiths" in which those who made silver figures of Artemis the pagan godess of the city rioted because Paul's preaching was bad for business. In the 1st century AD, the Apostle Paul spent over three years in Ephesus and he sermonized many times, disapproving pagan worship, in this theater.

<doc id="160750" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=160750" title="Kingdom of Tungning">
Kingdom of Tungning

The Kingdom of Tungning was the first Han Chinese government to rule Taiwan. It ruled between 1661 and 1683. It was a pro-Ming Dynasty kingdom. It was started by Koxinga, after the destruction of Ming government by the Manchu. Koxinga was son of a pirate who was a supporter of the Ming Dynasty. He hoped to get his soldiers together on Taiwan and use it as a base to get back mainland China for the Ming Dynasty.
The Kingdom of Tungning is also sometimes known as:
Admiral Koxinga called Taiwan Tungtu/Dongdu. In western history books it is known as the Kingdom of Taiwan.
In 1661, Koxinga forced a landing at Luerhmen, Taiwan. In less than a year, he took Fort Zeelandia and made an agreement with Frederick Coyett, the Dutch governor. The Dutch gave him the fort and left all the goods and property of the Dutch East India Company behind. All the Dutch people, officials and soldiers were able take their "personal" things and supplies back to Batavia in safety. This ended 38 years of Dutch colonial rule on Taiwan. Koxinga kept himself busy making Taiwan into a useful base for anti-Qing Dynasty supporters who hoped to get the Ming Dynasty back to power.
In 1662, at the age of 39, Koxinga died of malaria. Some people said that he died in a sudden fit of craziness when he heard about the death of his father under the Qing. His son, Zheng Jing, took control as the ruler of Taiwan, with the name of Prince of Yanping.
For the next 19 years, Zheng Jing tried to run the country and rebuild his army in Taiwan. Contact with the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty from the China through ambassadors was frequent. Zheng Jing fought the Qing to defend Xiamen, Quemoy and the Pescadores islands, which he finally lost over the years. His small army army was not big enough to defend the islands from the Qing. During Revolt of the Three Feudatories, Zheng Jing started an attack in the Fujian area. At the end of the revolt, Zheng's army was defeated. After the defeat, Zheng went back to Taiwan where he spent his time with wine and women, dying soon after of illness. After his death, his generals and ministers were split into two groups, each supporting one of his sons to take take over. After some fighting, Zheng Keshuang, his 12 year old son, became the new king.
In 1683, after the Battle of Penghu, Zheng Keshuang gave himself up to the Qing. His kingdom was added to the Qing Dynasty as part of the Fujian Province.
The Kingdom of Tungning lasted for just over 20 years. Because its history is almost the same as modern Taiwan, it has great symbolic value.
After its defeat in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the Republic of China (ROC), led by the Kuomintang, went to Taiwan. They left mainland China to the Communist Party who started the People's Republic of China (PRC). For many years, the ROC planned to take control of the mainland. It kept island bases close to the mainland (for example, Quemoy). This was the same as Koxinga and his sons had done. The ROC has now become a democracy and no longer wants to take over the mainland. The political and territorial arrangement has not changed. In this way, it is the same as between the Qing/Koxinga situation and the current PRC/ROC situation.
The Kuomintang of the ROC have talked a lot about the goals of Koxinga. They were going to use Taiwan as a base for returning their government to Mainland China. They see themselves as the defenders of the ROC. They see Taiwan as a base from which the ROC will take back control of the mainland. The PRC talks about the fact that Koxinga freed Taiwan from Dutch colonialism for the sake of the motherland. They do not talk about the fact that Koxinga was trying to get rid of the mainland government, to bring back an earlier dynasty.

Bredevoort

Bredevoort is a small village of about 1,600 inhabitants, in the municipality of Aalten, in the region of Achterhoek in the Netherlands. It is between the towns of Aalten and Winterswijk.
Today they name Bredevoort also "Bredevoort boekenstad" ("Bredevoort book town"), there are now more than twenty second-hand book shops in the town. 
The name Bredevoort appears for the first time in 1188, when the earl of Steinfurt tried to sell his share of the castle to the bishop of Münster and the earl of Lohn tried to sell his share to the earl of Gelderland, a war broke out between the bishop and the earl of Gelderland. The fight lasted for almost two centuries. From 1326, Bredevoort was actual part of Gelderland. Between 1326 and 1696 the municipality of Bredevoort repeatedly changed ownership during the eighties years of war. In 1646, lightning hit the gunpowder tower of the castle of Bredevoort, causing an explosion that destroyed the castle and the town, killing Lord Haersolte of Bredevoort and his family, as well as others. Only one son, Anthonie, who was not home that day, survived. The former municipality of Bredevoort was comprised of the city, the castle Bredevoort, and the villages Aalten, Dinxperlo and Winterswijk. After centuries of war, its fortifications were demolished by its residents. In 1818, the municipality of Bredevoort was dissolved to become part of the city Bredevoort under the newly formed municipality Aalten.

British Rail coach designations

The London, Midland and Scottish Railway and the London and North Eastern Railway both developed a system of identifying carriages by means of alphabetic codes. When British Railways was formed in 1948, it decided to adopt the former LNER method of carriage classification.
The codes are made up from a combination of letters, some of which can indicate more than one word; their meaning can only be determined according to their position, or the presence of other letters, in the code. The letters used are:
These letters (except for "Y" and "Z") did not usually apply to the wide variety of passenger-rated but goods carrying vans (e.g. parcels vans, horse boxes, milk and fish vans). Their codes were an acronym of their traditional railway description, e.g. GUV for General Utility Vans.
The following list lists those codes that were actually used on British Railways, cross-referred to the comparable code used by the LMS, with the exception that the letter "S" (""Second", later "Standard") is used where until 1956 the letter "T" ("Third") is used. Suffix codes "Y" or "Z" are not shown, as these could apply to variants of any or all vehicle types.
In the original LNER coding system, "S" stood for "Second", an intermediate class between "First" and "Third" (which later became "Second"). The original "Second" was more or less abolished in the 1870s (as a result of the Railway Regulation Act 1844), remaining only in limited use for special services, such as those meeting ships (which retained the three-class system from which railway classifications had originated). In the 1980s, BR renamed "Second" to "Standard". Many of the classifications listed below are no longer used, and some did not survive until the designation "Standard"".
Note that in modern usage, composite semi-open vehicles are classified "Cso" – the "s" signifying that the Standard portion is open (implying that the First portion is compartments with corridor).

Paddington station

Paddington railway station, also known as London Paddington, is a main National Rail, and London Underground station, in the Baker Street area of northwest central London.
The site is old, having been as the London end of the Great Western Railway and its successors since 1838. Much of the current mainline station dates from 1854, and was made by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The site was first served by Underground trains in 1863, and was the first western end point of the Metropolitan Railway, the world's first underground railway.
The station has been made better not long ago. It now has an extra job as the London end point for the Heathrow Express airport service. Paddington is in Travelcard Zone 1.
The fast services are run by First Great Western. The main stations for the services are shown below:
There are also trains to Slough, Ealing, Heathrow Airport and Maidenhead.
Two trains from Paddington go to Heathrow Airport. The Heathrow Express travels, and doesn't stop, at a high fare. The Heathrow Connect takes the same line but, calls at most stations.
Below are the lines and main stations on the line:
The National Rail part is named London Paddington, a name used outside London, but not by many people who live there. Parts of the station, like the main train shed, were built in 1854 by Isambard Kingdom Brunel as the London end point for the Great Western Railway (GWR). Today, it is one of 18 UK railway stations looked after by Network Rail.
Paddington has 14 end platforms, numbered 1 to 14. Platforms 1 to 8 are below the oldest three parts of Brunel's 1854 train shed, and platforms 9 to 12 are below the fourth part. Platforms 13 and 14 are within the Metropolitan Railway's old Bishop's Road station to the north-west. There are two through platforms, 15 and 16, used by the London Underground's Hammersmith & City and Circle lines.

The United Kingdom consists of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and previously consisted of Great Britain and the whole of Ireland. Rail transport systems developed independently on the two islands of Great Britain and Ireland, and most of the railway construction in the Republic of Ireland was undertaken before independence in 1922. Thus, the logical division to discuss the history and present-day state of railways in these areas is by geographical division, rather than the political division of nation states.

Edward Cave

Edward Cave, ( February 27 1691 – January 10 1754), was an English printer, editor and publisher. In "The Gentleman's Magazine" he made the first general-interest "magazine". 
The son of a cobbler, Cave was born in Newton near Rugby, Warwickshire and attended the grammar school there. Cave was made to leave after it was said he stole from the headmaster. He worked at a number of different jobs, such as selling timber, writing and printing. He came up with the idea of a periodical that would cover every subject the educated public was interested in, from commerce to poetry. He tried to get some London printers and booksellers to take up the idea. When no one showed any interest, Cave took on the job by himself. "The Gentleman's Magazine" was started in 1731 and soon became the most important and most copied periodical of its time. It also made Cave very rich.
Cave was a smart businessman. He gave all his energy to the magazine, and hardly ever left its offices at St John's Gate, Clerkenwell. He made use of a lot of writers, the most famous was Samuel Johnson, who was always thankful to Cave for having given him his main job for many years. Cave himself often sent in items to the Magazine under the pen name of Sylvanus Urban. 
He also got permission from Lewis Paul for 250 spindles for his patent roller-spinning machine, an early model of the water frame. In 1742 he bought Marvels Mill at Northampton and made this into a cotton mill. This was probably the first water-powered spinning mill in the world. This should have made a lot of money, but it did not. It closed about 1761. 
Cave suffered from gout. He is buried at St. James Church, Clerkenwell.

Great Rift Valley

The Great Rift Valley is a name given to the continuous geographical trench, about 6,000 kilometres (3,700 mi) in length, that runs from northern Syria in Southwest Asia to central Mozambique in East Africa. The rift is bordered by a series of mountains and active volcanoes. It is a site of faults and earthquakes.
Basically, the western part of Africa is rifting away from the eastern part body. This causes all the geological activity at the Valley. Far in the future, a sea will run between these two parts of Africa. The Arabian peninsula is already almost separated. The whole process is part of plate tectonics. In eastern Africa, the valley divides into two, the Western Rift Valley and the Eastern Rift Valley. 
There are about 20 UNESCO World Heritage Sites which owe their formation to the geography and geology of the Great Rift Valley.
The Western Rift is edged by some of the highest mountains in Africa. It contains the Rift Valley lakes, which include some of the deepest lakes in the world (up to 1,470 metres deep at Lake Tanganyika). Much of this area is inside national parks.
Lake Victoria, the second largest area freshwater lake in the world, is between the two branches. All of the African Great Lakes were formed as the result of the rift, and most lie within its rift valley.
The African Great Lakes are a series of lakes formed by the action of the tectonic East African Rift on the continent of Africa. They include Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the world in terms of surface area, and Lake Tanganyika, the world's second largest in volume as well as the second deepest. 
The African Great Lakes are divided among three different catchments (river basins), and a number, such as Lake Turkana, have internal drainage systems. These are the largest, in order of size from largest to smallest:
The lakes in the Eastern Rift have no outlet to the sea and tend to be shallow, they have a high mineral content as the evaporation of water leaves the salts behind. 
Lake Malawi (or Lake Nyasa: the name is disputed) is the most southern of the Great Lakes, and empties into the great Zambezi River via the Shire River.

Third baseman

A third baseman is a person in baseball who covers third base.
Somebody playing third base must have good reflexes and be able to react fast, because he is one the closest infielders to the batter. He must also have a good arm, because third basemen sometimes have to throw to second base as a part of a double play.

Scottish Parliament

The Scottish Parliament (; Scots: "Scottish Pairlament") is the devolved national legislature of Scotland. It is in the capital city, Edinburgh. The Parliament is sometimes called "Holyrood". 
The original Parliament of Scotland (or "Estates of Scotland") was the national legislature of the independent Kingdom of Scotland. It existed from the early 13th century until 1707. This was when the Kingdom of Scotland merged with the Kingdom of England under the Acts of Union 1707 to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. Because of this, the Parliament of Scotland merged with the Parliament of England to form the "Parliament of Great Britain", which sat at Westminster in London.
In 1997 there was a referendum where the Scottish people voted for Scotland to have a Parliament again. The current Parliament was established by the Scotland Act 1998. The first meeting was on 12 May 1999.
The Parliament is a devolved assembly, which means that some powers have been kept by the UK Parliament. The issues which the Scottish Parliament can make laws about are called "devolved matters". The issues which the UK Parliament must make laws about are called "reserved matters".
Some examples of devolved matters are health and social services, education and housing. Examples of reserved matters are foreign policy, immigration and the constitution of the Scottish Parliament.
There are 129 members known as Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) who are democratically elected. Members are elected for four-year terms. Most of the MSPs belong to political parties. Independent MSPs do not belong to a political party. 
The number of MSPs from each party are:

Joule's laws

Joule's laws are two: first about heat produced by an electric current, and second about how the energy of a gas relates to pressure, volume and temperature.
Joule's first law shows the relation between heat generated by an electric current flowing through a conductor. It is named after James Prescott Joule and shown as:
Where "Q" is the amount of heat, "I" is the electric current flowing through a conductor, "R" is the amount of electric resistance present in the conductor, and "t" is the amount of time that this happens for. 
Joule's second law says that the internal energy of an ideal gas does not change if volume and pressure change, but does change if temperature changes.

Pinnacle Point Man

The Pinnacle Point Man is a name given to a group of Homo sapiens believed to have lived in a cave at Pinnacle Point 164,000 years ago. This cave is near Mosselbaai/Mossel Bay on the south coast South Africa. Discoveries in the cave show that these early humans were able to work with haematite pieces, and used ochre to paint their bodies. The discovery challenges the widely held belief that modern human behaviour began only 45,000 years ago. It also challenges the view that this behaviour was reached through a "large cultural leap".
Because the African climate became cool and dry, the food resources were reduced dramatically. This was the reason why the Pinnacle Point man moved to the shores. There, they could eat marine creatures like mussels, snails and crabs. These men also used amazingly subtle tools. Microliths were mounted on wood shafts
The startling discovery was made in 2007 by an international team, including the palaeoanthropologist Curtis Marean from the "Institute of Human Origins" of the Arizona State University and three graduate students of the "School of Human Evolution and Social Change". They came to the conclusion that humans living in the cave started to eat new foods. They added shellfish and other marine resources to their diet. The cause for this evolution was the climate change. It is the first evidence that mankind was able to this. The report in the magazine Nature also reports that the evidence for using coloured pigments was also found. This is much earlier than the earliest known usage which had been from 70,000 years ago.
The findings give rise to the assumption that living near the coast has caused the changes.
The evidence shows that Homo sapiens evolved in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. At that time, the world was in an ice age, and Africa was a desert. But as archaeologica sites dating to that time period are rare in Africa, palaeonthologist Curtis Marean looked at different information. He studied geologic formations, the sea currents, climate data and much more. As a result, he was able to pinpoint his research to destinations like the Pinnacle Point cave, where the findings have been made.

Matt Smith (actor)

Matthew Robert Smith (born 28 October 1982) is an English stage and television actor. He is best known as the eleventh form of the Doctor on the British television series "Doctor Who". He got a BAFTA Award nomination for the role in 2011.
He wanted to be a professional footballer. A back injury made him stop playing the sport. He joined the National Youth Theatre and studied Drama and Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia. Smith became an actor in 2003. He performed in plays like "Murder in the Cathedral", "Fresh Kills", "The History Boys" and "On the Shore of the Wide World" in London theatres. On West End, he has performed in "Swimming with Sharks" with Christian Slater, and "That Face".
Smith's first television role was in 2006. He played Jim Taylor in the BBC version of Phillip Pullman's "The Ruby in the Smoke" and "The Shadow in the North". His his first major role in television came as Danny in the 2007 BBC series "Party Animals". Smith is the youngest person to play the character in the British television series.
Smith was born and brought up in Northampton. He attended Northampton School for Boys. He planned to be a professional football player. Smith had played for the youth teams of Northampton Town F.C., Nottingham Forest F.C. and Leicester City F.C. After an injury, he began to study acting. After school, Smith studied Drama and Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia. 
While acting in "On the Shore of the Wide World", the play moved to the Royal National Theatre in London. After finishing, he took on the role of Lockwood in the Alan Bennett play "The History Boys". After "The History Boys", he acted in "Burn/Chatroom/Citizenship" and "Swimming with Sharks". ""Swimming with Sharks was his first West End play. His first television role was as Jim Taylor in the BBC version of the "Sally Lockhart" series of books "The Ruby in the Smoke" and "The Shadow in the North". He acted along with Billie Piper in the series. He acted with Piper a third time in an episode of "Secret Diary of a Call Girl". Piper is well known for playing the part of Rose Tyler on Doctor Who. 
Smith was revealed as the Eleventh Doctor in the British science-fiction television series "Doctor Who" in January 2009 to replace David Tennant, who announced his departure in October 2008. Smith was not as well known as many of the actors who were thought to be likely to get the part. These included Paterson Joseph, David Morrissey, Sean Pertwee, James Nesbitt, Russell Tovey, Catherine Zeta Jones, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Robert Carlyle and Billie Piper. 
Smith was one of the first actors to audition for the role. Producer Steven Moffat and BBC Wales Head of Drama and executive producer, Piers Wenger immediately liked him for the part. Smith had auditioned for the role of John Watson in the Moffat-created "Sherlock" at the same time. He did not get the part of Watson because Moffat believed his acting style was closer to Sherlock Holmes but they had already cast Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes. At 26 years old, Smith was three years younger than Peter Davison was at the time of his casting as the Doctor in 1981. He was younger than any other actor suggested for the role. After three weeks of auditions, Moffat and Wenger agreed that it had "always been Matt". The BBC were was not certain that a 26-year-old could not play the Doctor correctly. Some fans of the show believed that Smith was too young for the role. Others supported him based on what he had shows of his acting ability. For his work in his first series he was nominated in the "Outstanding Drama Performance
Category" of the National Television Awards.
In June 2010, he appeared on stage with Orbital. They performed a version of the "Doctor Who" theme at the Glastonbury Festival. Smith hosted the "Doctor Who" Prom at the Royal Albert Hall on 24–25 July 2010. In June 2011, the BBC said that Smith had been signed to do fourteen more episodes of "Doctor Who" as the Doctor.

Web services

A Web service is defined as "a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network". Web services are frequently just Web APIs that can be accessed over a network, such as the Internet, and executed on a remote system hosting the requested services.
The W3C Web service definition encompasses many different systems, but in common usage the term refers to clients and servers that communicate over the HTTP protocol used on the Web. Such services tend to fall into one of two camps: Big Web Services and RESTful Web Services.
"Big Web Services" use XML messages that follow the SOAP standard and have been popular with traditional enterprise. In such systems, there is often a machine-readable description of the operations offered by the service written in the Web Services Description Language (WSDL). The latter is not a requirement of a SOAP endpoint, but it is a prerequisite for automated client-side code generation in many Java and .NET SOAP frameworks (frameworks such as Spring, Apache Axis2 and Apache CXF being notable exceptions). Some industry organizations, such as the WS-I, mandate both SOAP and WSDL in their definition of a Web service.
More recently, RESTful Web services have been regaining popularity, particularly with Internet companies. These also meet the W3C definition, and are often better integrated with HTTP than SOAP-based services. They do not require XML messages or WSDL service-API definitions.

Pricing

Pricing is the creation of a price. In a market economy the price is made by supply and demand. The suppliers would like to get the price as high as possible and the consumers would like to pay as few as possible. Prices will be built if consumers and salesmen make an agreement of the exchange of goods.
There are many consumers but only a few suppliers.
There are many consumers but only one supplier.
Many suppliers are compared to many consumers. By the low market share of the individual supplier you call it "atomize market structure". You also call this market form competitive market.
The supplier will offer more goods, if the market price is rising. (and backwards)
The consumer will demand more goods, if the market price drops. (and backwards)

OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturing. It is mainly used to describe parts for cars, airplanes and electrical systems. It is also used for computer parts and computer programs.
The name OEM is usually used when a new version of something is made by a company that is different to the company that first made it. The new company will sell the product at a cheaper price, but this is often because it does not have as many features as the first version. For example, an OEM computer program will usually only come with the disc and a licence, but no instruction manuals.

It is covered by a layer of fat, which is covered by the mons pubis.
It can be separated into a body, a superior ramus and an inferior ramus.
The body forms one-fifth of the acetabulum (the area around the hip socket), contributing by its outer surface both to the lunate surface and the acetabular fossa (the hip socket itself). Its inner surface enters into the formation of the wall of the lesser pelvis and gives origin to a part of the obturator internus.
In the female, the pubic bone is in front of the urethral sponge.
The left and right hip bones join at the pubic symphysis.

Regarding his , I have warned him on two seperate occasions and so has here. I advised him that it is his last warning, any further and he will be blocked. 09:41, 31 December 2008 (UTC)
I think that Jonas's POV (I am under no circumstances demeaning them) just naturally make it hard for him to adhere to and . Jonas is extremely opinionated, and I'm not really sure that's a good thing. 13:01, 31 December 2008 (UTC)
I think it's time Jonas was banned. He doesn't seem to really care about Wikipedia, or its community, and seems to only be here to act as a self-appointed in-house critic and martyr. As I said above, I think he's net negative, and we'll be able to function better without him hanging around acting like a pest. 18:25, 31 December 2008 (UTC)
Edit conflict
OK, this is a rather long reply, I'd appreciate it if you read through it.
FastReverter's warning to me was later retracted, on his talk page. This should not be used as evidence for the claim that I personally attack people, as it is now an invalid accusation. 
The comment about Armenians, I later retracted, which also does not count. I agree that that comment was out of line, and should not have been made.
The slaveowner edit is backed up by evidence. I was rather suspicious about the claim, which was already "in the article", so I did a search for it. This is what I found. Thus, I reformatted that claim. This should not be seen as POV. It is not a POV whether one ownes slaves or not.
As far as the NPOV on the Death penalty, Either way can feel free to remove the section, unless a citation can be provided (like from HRW or Amnesty International). I am not going to fight over it. 
SwirlBoy's response is invalid. He has, on three occasions, tricked me on #wikipedia-simple Internet Relay Chat channel. He has gotten me disconnected from IRC, by getting me to /nick to some of his registered nicknames, and has tricked me into having information linking my new (at the time) IP address to User:Ionas68224, when he lied about it being on Private chat. He also "pwned" me by pretending that he was on my side, against Creol, that he thought that Creol was abusive. Of course this was all a trick, and I believe his support for my ban above is just a way to gain power. He wants administrators against dissent to think he is on their side.
Majorly has only been antagonistic towards me. "He does barely anything of use here". Does Majorly? Is Majorly such a great editor that he can say that? If this was me saying that to Majorly, would it not have been considered a personal attack?
As far as FastReverter's complaint about a soapbox, users are allowed to keep their opinions about WP on their userpage. It is a review of how Wikipedia accepts certain people, and blocks others, and how we should act as educators, not antagonists to learning. The governance model and blocking policy is so Anglocentric, even though we are supposed to be educating those who do not speak English. 
The ban reasons are pathetic. Really, come up with something better than that.
Also of note is the comments about "types of editors", by Majorly and Razorflame. This proves that Wikipedia tolerates certain "kinds" of editors, and those who are not of the "kind" of tolerable, good boy Wikipedian are banned. There you go. One more reason not to stuff Jimbo's wallet: Wikipedia is full of liars. Those who say that this is an educational project, yet block when there is an editor that the Project doesn't like.
I am not here to cause "havoc", or I wouldn't have created articles (listed on my userpage). "Disruptive" is positive when the system is wrong. For me to prove it is only my duty. I don't really disrupt, but I believe disruption is good when it proves the frailties of a system. 19:28, 31 December 2008 (UTC)
Swirlboy's opinions is invalid for this reason, Majorly should not be counted for that.. Bullshit. Pure and simple. Others are not at issue here. Shifting blame and discounting the opinions of others just because you yourself have issues with that opinion is a moot point. 
End result: YOU are on trial here. Your actions and behavior are the only things that matters. You are ultimately responsible for what you do. All the goading in the world does not give you reason to receptively act in the manner you do. Only you are responsible for that and only you are accountable for your actions. Random exceptions can be overlooked, but ongoing behaviour by you is solely your responsibility. The fact that you can not see that your actions lead to results (Cause and effect) is sadly just something you hopefully will one day understand. - What you do will always have repercussions. You want to act like a self-righteous asshole, expect others to treat you like one. 
You will sit and whine about being abused and treated unfairly. You will say it is about the establishment trying to silence to voice of opposition.. You are a fool. As Archer said above, this is not a democratic, by the people (and apparently "the people" means those who agree with you) project. This is a group that is determined to work together as a group to put forward a product. AS A GROUP. You are not willing to, not have you ever shown a willingness to, work as a member of a group. You has pointed out time and again you can not even function as a member of your own flesh and blood family. You can not and will not ever accept being a part of a group who does not cow-tow to your specific beliefs and kiss your ass doing it. You are not a member of a team and as such should never be welcome here as you are only about pushing your own personal agenda and could care less about the actual product. You couldn't give a shit about us but expect us to respect you.. You are a silly little twit who has never done anything to earn anyone's respect. You bash others for their actions (ie. Majorly for his activity level in the mainspace) when you have not earned the right to even go there. Eptalon?, Cethegus, even Razor.. they made that remark I could respect it, but you have not earned the right. You have not put forth the effort to be allowed to bitch about him. You are all about what you see is wrong and what others tell you to think is wrong.. You do nothing to do what is right or correct the issues - you only toss out complaints. You do nothing to help and a world to hurt. You are not welcome. I may disagree with many people on certain things (ask Majorly) but I almost always respect their right to say them and their opinion (whether I agree or disagree). You- I have no respect for. You have done nothing to earn it and yet you DEMAND it from people. The only thing here that is pathetic is not the ban reasons, it is you thinking your behaviour is acceptable in general culture. -- 10:31, 1 January 2009 (UTC)
Hello Jonas, Hello Community,
There was a commotion in the admin community when I pushed through your unban, about 3-4 months ago. This community has given you enough opportunities to show your worth. There are probably many articles here that interest you, and there is also a lot to be done to get a fair socialist or even anarchist perspective into these articles. As an editor, you have been treated no differently than other editors. What is the actual result we have seen from this? -
Most of your edits are still devoted to Userspace (or Wikipedia namespace), little is devoted to editing articles. A community is nice to have, but the community here is devoted to creating an encyclopedia. You yourself have written you will devote more time to editing Mumia Abu-Jamal. I am sure you also have a lot of information that can be added to articles like Ernesto Guevara de la Serna (Che Guevara), which is just a stub at the moment. You can also see that the opposition to your being here is growing. I think the only way to avert another ban is to radically change your editing patterns, and focus on articles. I also think that in the spirit of an apology would be in order to give to those you have offended with your bitey behaviour. -- () 11:22, 1 January 2009 (UTC)
I have carried out the block, based on the consensus above. 13:18, 1 January 2009 (UTC)
Hello,
I'm just cross posting, in hopes to get more discussion (consensus) at my request here. Very best, () 17:37, 1 January 2009 (UTC)
Title says it all really. Per my note at . Please leave my bots unblocked, as well as account creation by my IP and email by my username. It's all explained there, but if you want more reasoning i can give it. This is mainly to stop the "urge" of editing, and im choosing this option over others as password b0rking would prevent return, i dont think the enforcer works and i can get around it, so this is preferable.
Thanks,
If you can confirm that something like works, I can protect the page for the time desired. 01:58, 2 January 2009 (UTC)
Absolutely under no circumstances is a block going to be placed on you BG7. Its either this, or you just leave your computer turned off. 02:09, 2 January 2009 (UTC)
Over the last few days, I've noticed a vandal who uses multiple IP addresses to add "Hi. Good site." to articles (often replacing the entire content of the article). They've also added nonsense edit summaries when they do. Here are some examples: . Any clue(s) what, if anything, can be done here? Right now I'm leaning towards the "nothing can be done" because it's on totally separate IPs each time, it's always just one edit from the account, and it seems to be random what articles are hit. Any thoughts? () 14:00, 2 January 2009 (UTC)
Admins, when you delete an article as "moved to Wiktionary," could you possibly update any links to these articles? Just browsing through some of the articles were deleted today, I see upwards of a dozen links in some cases that are now redlinked because they link to the deleted page. It would be best if these were updated (perhaps someone can set up an AWB on this?). Thanks, () 22:41, 2 January 2009 (UTC)
I've been doing some work. I've had to copy over some templates because they are either used in articles, or used in the BLP page I'm converting. Please don't delete them, if you do, let me know so I can workaround. Best, () 17:44, 4 January 2009 (UTC)
Jonas recently sent me this e-mail, requesting that I act as a messenger (I'm fine with my promotion, and guarantee that all sensible messages from Jonas to me (and hopefully other admins) will appear here). He proposes an account allowed only to edit articles.
"I propose that a Wikipedia user creates an account called User:Jonas_editor, identifies their main account on that user page, saying on the user page that all edits with that account were made by Jonas Dalton Rand. The user will copy articles created by me on an external website. I also may point out edits to already existing articles, which additionally should be done with this account. I have not yet determined what website that I would like to do this on. The user will only make article edits, and create articles, but not discuss anything. Questions about the account should go to the main account's talk page."
"I did not get banned for creating articles. Since poor writing was not the reason for my ban, articles written by me should be okay to include into Wikipedia. Who the articles were created by, and who originally proposed an edit has nothing to do with the quality of the article, unless the user only creates bad quality pages. Since I don't, I feel that there's no reason that articles written by me should not be submitted into this website."
"Thoughts, comments, and questions are appreciated."
"Jonas Rand"
Thoughts, comments, and questions are appreciated.
-- 22:22, 5 January 2009 (UTC)
Just a quick clarification (after some IRC chatting). I was not "proposing" anything. I was not suggesting an unblock, a mentorship or that we should follow through with Jonas' demands above. This was simply because he requested that this be posted here and discussed - which I've done. -- 01:34, 6 January 2009 (UTC)
Side note: Due to 12 edits after being banned over 5 time periods in the first 4 days of the year (9 IP, 2 from his main account and one from a hidden sock), I hard blocked his IP for one year as well (and the sock indef). The message here does not seem to be getting through to him. Jonas is not welcome here in any manner. He used all of his chances (and a few extras) and needs to just forget we exist and move on to other people to push his opinion on. -- 06:33, 6 January 2009 (UTC)
Could an Admin please semi-protect please? Thanks.--    07:06, 10 January 2009 (UTC)
My personal opinion is that CM16 meant well, but it would've been better not to blatantly canvass so many people. 14:12, 10 January 2009 (UTC)
Let's not beat him over the head with it. He was asking for help in a way, which is commendable. While I think it would have been better just to post to a couple people at a time, he is trying to better himself atleast so I will give him the benefit of the doubt. - () 14:54, 10 January 2009 (UTC)
CM, I commend you for taking positive steps. I do want to remind you to keep the English Wikipedia meta stuff (unbanning efforts) , off of the Simple English Wikipedia. Unless of course the community is ok with it. If that is the case, I won't resist. They are however, two seperate projects. Good job here and on your editing. Keep up the good work! Best, () 18:16, 10 January 2009 (UTC)
There is a discussion on crediting DYK editors . () 23:07, 11 January 2009 (UTC)
Hello all,
it looks like Synergy laid down his Admin privileges over a misunderstanding yesterday; I therefore propose to re-instate him. Please voice your opinion; If there is consensus, a bureaucrat can re-instate him on the 16th of this month. -- () 22:45, 13 January 2009 (UTC)
If the community thinks that it wasn't that big of an issue, I will resume my duties as an admin. I was told offwiki by admins and editors who know and understand the headings issue, that it would have caused a major problem if I had not reversed it. A mistake of that magnitude was completely unacceptable, and from what I am used to, would call for a desysoping so I did what any responsible person (or at least I thought) should have done. Which was correct it and take full responsibility for my actions. It was never about "I don't want to be an admin", so if, and when the community agrees, I would not decline the rights being restored. 23:52, 13 January 2009 (UTC)
Just to comment: my advice wasn't bad advice - just incorrect for the WMF. I went of extensive testing I did on my own wiki, and told Synergy that, but didn't cross-check with WMF devs. Synergy et al assumed that I had, and so Synergy made the page deletions. I accept I messed up, and i'm more at fault than Synergy. Thanks, 00:36, 14 January 2009 (UTC)
I don't even know what exactly you did to make you want to give up the flag yesterday (when I asked, you blanked my post asking you why). I would definitely support him coming back as an administrator, but whatever happened is nagging at me ;). Cheers, 01:27, 14 January 2009 (UTC)
There is a straw poll to gauge rough consensus at this place. () 15:32, 16 January 2009 (UTC)
As noted here some articles were moved without attribution. Since there is a great number, is there someone with a bot that can fix them, or as a last resort, a deletion that could be executed so the articles can be reuploaded when the article maker has time to do them properly? Note that deletion is not prefered here, but fixing it is. I just don't have the time to at the moment. They are currently, and unfortunately. license violation without attribution. () 15:27, 16 January 2009 (UTC)
I have serious concerns over the that is ongoing at Barack Obama. For those not following it: Gwib semi-protected the page for three days, it was objected to on his talk page by Synergy (and myself). Synergy unprotected it, and Gwib restored the protection ten hours later. These kinds of actions cannot occur on Wikipedia. In cases like this, an administrator needs to seek consensus before implementing changes that they know may be controversial (because of the "warring" that is occurring). () 11:35, 21 January 2009 (UTC)
Based on this and the wheel warring here, 
I would ask that one of three things happen. 
or
or
I have little tolerance for this. () 12:09, 21 January 2009 (UTC)
I do not believe that this page should be indefinitely semi-protected. I think that it should be semi-protected for a period of a week until the buzz from the inauguration has died down. At that point in time, it should be safe to unprotect it. As other editors have stated, blocks are pointless here because of the different IP addresses that would be used. If it were just one range of IP addresses, then I would be in support of a block, but since it is many different IP addresses, blocks won't work. Cheers, 14:43, 21 January 2009 (UTC)
There seems to be consensus to keep the article protected, that's great. (Personally, I disagree with it, but if that's the consensus, I can accept that). This consensus should have/could have been sought earlier is my point, though. Admins should not be reverting each others' actions without a solid discussion. Had this discussion occurred after Synergy's undoing of it, or before Synergy's undoing of it, then we could have avoiding unnecessary drama. Please, please, please admins...DISCUSS. () 15:20, 21 January 2009 (UTC)
I'm not very familiar with Simple English Wikipedia's protection policy, but I propose to semi-protect Adolf Hitler. The article is very bad already, and the vandalism makes the history difficult to read. -- () 03:56, 19 January 2009 (UTC)
Nothign has happened so far except for more Vandalism. Can someone please comment? -- () 14:25, 26 January 2009 (UTC)
When scanning the wanted templates, I noticed that has 56 links. When doing further checking, I believe it is referenced inside a welcome template that we are using. Resulting in broken welcome messages. See this talk page where the referenced template and "selected article" is redlinked. I have checked the standard templates that we are using, and I don't see the references. This leads me to believe that a bot or userscript is inserting the text that causes the redlinked welcome message. Any ideas? () 16:54, 24 January 2009 (UTC)
A new user has register under the name . I believe this falls under the improper username thing and therefore should be blocked.--  06:53, 26 January 2009 (UTC)
I took care of the deletions and the bug report was filed. There may still be a few stray ones, if you find them, either let me know, or tag them for qd. 21:00, 12 January 2009 (UTC)
"(reset)" When is the change going to take place? 04:47, 28 January 2009 (UTC)
Absolutely outrageous! What the hell is going on here? He jumps in to BG7's RfA with a co-nom that no-one knew about. Next when he is told that he should not have co-nom'd he removes his support out of spite and strong opposes "I didn't know yadda yadda" - This gives the strong impression there is something seriously wrong with BG7 that even his co-nominator changes to strong oppose. This is the type of behaviour that got him banned in the first place. He doesn’t think. Which brings me on to my next point: No-one thinks. Especially in RfA's. BG7 has done months of good work. A bit of a bad patch IRL (everyone has them) and they all pick on that to oppose him. 
Because of FR's atrocious behaviour, of which I am livid about, I propose the community ban is reinstated. He has been warned about other things more than once, and seems to enjoy making mistakes so that he gets . He has made a huge error in judgement here, so far that people are opposing because of him.
I’ve had enough. He does more harm than good in general, and its time for him to go. 09:12, 19 January 2009 (UTC)
I have had a chance to look over the last 500 contributions to mainspace. May I propose an alternate proposal? I propose a three month ban of the project space.
Alternate proposal: Perhaps just assigning a mentor?
Thoughts? () 17:33, 19 January 2009 (UTC)
For now, just watch his behaviour.--n 03:26, 21 January 2009 (UTC)
Sorry guys, but I do not believe that his actions as of yet are justifiable of a ban at this point in time. He simply has not done anything that could justify a ban at this point in time. Cheers, 14:37, 21 January 2009 (UTC)
Note to all: this is "not" his first offense. I encourage you to look at and . Add all of this behavior together, and... 20:06, 21 January 2009 (UTC)
I am unsure about this, but I believe that since this editor is editing new pages and pages about Disney, could it be the Disney vandal at work again? Cheers, 01:59, 22 January 2009 (UTC)
I have noticed a possibility of a second disney vandal IP address. Could someone please check this? Cheers, 20:18, 25 January 2009 (UTC)
Could this be another disney vandal IP address? 19:58, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
Hi there all. I know that you probably know that this user is no longer with us anymore, and because of this, I would like to ask any administrator to fully protect his userpage and talk page here. 16:35, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
Hey can an admin undelete please? I don't remember QDing it but I must've.   04:10, 30 January 2009 (UTC)
Please unprotect . As long as the editor is still editing here, the talk page should not be fully protected. () 21:33, 31 January 2009 (UTC)
I would have to agree here. Talk pages are most certainly not supposed to be fully protected, even if the editor in question is not going to edit here anymore (there are, of course, exceptions, such as talk pages of those users who have died). Even if a user requests it, they almost never should be fully protected. Cheers, 21:47, 31 January 2009 (UTC)

Brown tree snake

The Brown tree snake ("Boiga irregularis") is an arboreal colubrid snake the lives in parts of coastal Australia, Papua New Guinea, and islands in northwestern Melanesia.
This snake is known for being an invasive species, responsible for killing the bird population on Guam.
The Brown tree snake eats birds, lizards, and bats. It also eats small rodents in its home. It also eats birds and shrews at Guam.
Due to the amount of prey and lack of predators in habitats such as Guam, they have been known to grow to larger sizes than their normal 1 to 2 meters in length. The longest recorded length of this species is one found on Guam was three meters.
Reproduction has not been looked at in detail. The female makes 4-12 eggs, 42-47 mm long and 18-22 mm wide with a leathery shell. Females make up to two groups, called clutches per year depending on season, climate. and amount of prey. The female places the eggs in hollow logs, rock cracks, and other places where they are likely protected from drying and high temperatures.
The Brown tree snake is a nocturnal snake that can be very aggressive when confronted. The fangs are grooved rather than hollow fangs, the poison is hard to place into a bite on a human, in this way, is only given in small amount. The venom appears to be weakly neurotoxic and possibly cytotoxic. Adults are not affectly in a great way, however, children are in greater danger.

Flogging

Flagellation or flogging is hitting the human body with a whip The word comes from "flagellum" the Latin word for "Whip". Usually it is done as a punishment. Some people also do it as a form of sexual arousal, in the context of BDSM.
Flogging was used to punish convicts in the penal colonies of Australia. After Irish convicts tried to start a riot at Castle Hill in 1804, many were flogged. Paddy Galvin was given 300 lashes at Parramatta, New South Wales. The first one hundred were across his back, and tore open his skin so the bones in his spine could be seen. The second hundred was given across his buttocks which became like jelly. A doctor ordered that the third hundred was given across the back of his legs. People watching were hit by pieces of skin and flesh. There are records in Tasmania of a convict named Greenwood, being given 1000 lashes for wounding an officer while trying to escape.

History of Curitiba

The history of Curitiba has many different periods.
In the past, the region where today is the city of Curitiba was a region of exuberant forest, where the parana-pine was dominant. The first inhabitants of the region were the indigenous tribe Tingüi, by the Tupi-Guarani nation.
At the beginning of the Christian Era, the Plateau Curitibano (also known as First Plateau of Paraná) was inhabited by peoples potters. Subterranean houses, found at archaeological sites on the outskirts of Curitiba, show the adaptation of native to the adverse conditions of climate, as the cold wind, frost and snow.
In time of arrival of the Portuguese to Brazil, the Plateau Curitibano was occupied by groups of linguistic families Jê and Tupi-Guarani.
The first ten years of the 16th century marked the beginning of a war of conquest of Europeans against the indigenous peoples who inhabited the plateaus of southeastern and southern Brazil. Were Portuguese and Spanish expeditions in search of precious metals and stones, and Indians to enslave. 
The region of Curitiba began to be populated by non-Indians around 1630, by people from Paranaguá, where the alluvium gold had been discovered, forming the village of "Our Lady of Light and Good Jesus of Pine Forest", which was became in town in 1693. The Portuguese who founded a village in 1693 gave it the name of "Vila da Nossa Senhora da Luz dos Pinhais" ("Our Lady of the Light in the Pine Forest"). The name was changed to "Curitiba" in 1721. 
There is a legend telling that around 1648 a group of pioneers founded a small village near the Atuba River while searching for gold. These pioneers venerated "Nossa Senhor da Luz" and made a special place there for her statue. The legend tells that every morning the image turned her eyes to a pine tree forest, which the pioneers knew was a sacred place of the Indians. The explorers took this as a sign that "Nossa Senhora" was showing them a special place for their village. Even though they knew that the Indians took them as enemies, the pioneers took the risk and went in to the forest to find this special place. When the pioneers got close to the tribe, a miracle happened: the Indians were peaceful and expecting them to come. Done contact with the leader of the Tingüi tribe, the cacique Tindiqüera would have said the new location and put a stick in the ground, saying "Coré Etuba" ("many pines"). By this stick would have grown a great tree, where today is the "zero mark" of Curitiba. At that place the pioneers built a chapel in honor of the saint, now called "Nossa Senhora da Luz dos Pinhais" ("Our Lady of the Light in the Pine Forest").
Curitiba officially became a town in 1812, orthography its name as "Curityba". An alternative orthography also came up: "Coritiba". This orthography looked to become dominant for it was used in press and state documents, but a state decree in 1919 decided the dispute by orthography the city name "Curitiba". Growth was based on the cattle trade, being a way between cattle breeding country to the South and markets to the North. Developing effective started from the beginning of the 19th century, with the exploitation and exportation of Yerba mate ("Ilex paraguariensis"), and the elevation to the condition that city in 1842.
Waves of European immigrants started arriving after 1850, mainly Germans, Italians, Poles and Ukrainians. In 1853, the south and southwest of the province of São Paulo are separated, forming the new province of Paraná, and Curitiba has become capital. The "Universidade Federal do Paraná" (Federal University of Paraná), the first in Brazil, was established in Curitiba in 1913, the same year in which electric streetcars were first deployed.
As most of Southern Brazil's population, Curitiba is mostly inhabited by Brazilians of European descent. The first Europeans to arrive in the region were of Portuguese origin, during the 17th century. They intermarried with the native people and with the African slaves.
In the 19th century, the influx of immigrants from Europe increased. In 1828, the first German immigrants settled in Paraná. However, large numbers of immigrants from Germany only arrived in Curitiba during the 1870s, most of them was Volga Germans from Russia.
Immigrants from Poland first arrived in 1871, settling in rural areas near to Curitiba. They largely influenced the agriculture of the region. Curitiba has the second largest Polish diaspora in the world, second only to Chicago, and is the only Brazilian city to have orthography in Polish language: "Kurytyba".
Italian immigrants started arriving in Curitiba in 1878. They came mostly from the Veneto and Trento regions, in Northern Italy and settled mostly in the Santa Felicidade neighborhood, still today the center of the large Italian community of Curitiba.
Large numbers of Ukrainian immigrants settled in Curitiba, mostly between 1895 and 1897, when 20 thousands arrived. They were peasants from Galicia, who immigrated to Brazil to become small farmers. Nowadays there are 300 thousand Ukrainian-Brazilians living in Paraná.
Japanese immigrants starting arriving in the region in 1915. Curitiba received significant numbers of immigrants from Japan. Nowadays, there are about 40 thousand Japanese-Brazilians living in the city. 
Other immigrants, such as jewishes, Arabs from Lebanon and Syria, English, French, Russians and other Eastern Europeans also settled in Curitiba.
During the 20th century, especially after the middle, the city is going through a large increase in population and is consolidating as regional hub for trade and services, becoming one of the richest cities in Brazil and pioneer in urban solutions. In the 1940s and 1950s, Alfred Agache, co-founder of the French Society for Urban Studies, was hired to produce the first city plan. It emphasised a "star" of boulevards, with public amenities downtown, an industrial district and sanitation. It was followed when possible, but was too expensive to complete.
By the 1960s, Curitiba's population had increased to 430,000, and some residents feared that the growth in population threatened to drastically change the character of the city. In 1964, Mayor Ivo Arzua solicited proposals for urban design. Architect Jaime Lerner - who later became mayor - led a team from the Universidade Federal do Paraná that suggested strict controls on urban sprawl, a reduction of traffic in the downtown area, preservation of Curitiba's Historic Sector, and a convenient and affordable public transit system. This plan, known as the Curitiba Master Plan, was adopted in 1968. Lerner closed the XV de Novembro St. to vehicles, because it had very high pedestrian traffic. The plan had a new road design to minimise traffic: the Trinary Road System. This uses two one-way streets moving in opposite directions which surround a smaller, two-lane street where the express buses have their exclusive lane. Five of these roads form a star that converges to the city centre. Land farther from these roads is zoned for lower density developments, to reduce traffic away from the main roads. A number of areas subject to floods were condemned and became parks.
Currently, the immigration of foreigners is small - is common only immigrants from China, some Middle Eastern and South American countries -, has been replaced by migration of Brazilians from other regions of the country (it is estimated that nowadays about half the population of Curitiba is composed of migrants).

Emerald ash borer

The emerald ash borer ("Agrilus planipennis" or "Agrilus marcopoli") is a shiny green beetle native to Asia. It made its way into the United States by accident and has since been spread to eleven states and to the border with Canada.
The beetle is an invasive species, and a serious pest which destroys ash trees. It has killed at least 25 million ash trees so far and threatens to kill most of the ash trees throughout North America.
Adults lay eggs in crevasses in the bark. Larvae burrow into the bark after hatching and consume the living tissue of cambium and phloem. This causes death within two years. The average emerging season for the emerald ash borer is early spring to late summer. Females lay around 75 eggs, but up to 300 from early May to mid-July. The borer's life cycle is estimated to be one year in southern Michigan but may be up to two years in colder regions.
Huge efforts have been made to slow down its spread, but nothing has worked so far. Parasitoid wasps from Asia are being released, and a fungus which kills insects is being tried.

<doc id="161382" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161382" title="Ratite">
Ratite

The ratites are a group of medium to large birds, most of which are flightless. Most of them, including the largest (moas and elephant birds) are now extinct. 
Unlike other flightless birds, the ratites have no keel on their sternum. In a flying bird the sternum anchors the wing muscles. 
Most parts of the former super-continent Gondwana have ratites, or did have until the fairly recent past. Their closest living relatives are the tinamous of South America.
The classification used here includes all ratites in the order Struthioniformes, but not the tinamous. This may change in future.
It was once thought that ratites were all one monophyletic group, which evolved together in Gondwana in the Upper Cretaceous. Then they evolved in their separate ways as Gondwana split up, and the parts drifted apart. The parts became the modern southern continents, plus Africa and the Indian subcontinent.
However, modern gene analysis conflicts with this. DNA analysis shows that the ratites diverged from one another too recently to share a common Gondwanian ancestor. However, all analyses show that rheas (South America) and the living Australasian/Oceanian ratites "are" monophyletic. 
Recent analysis of twenty nuclear genes suggests that the flighted tinamous cluster within the ratite lineage. The timamids are the sister group of the Australo-Pacific ratites.
If so, this would make 'ratites', as a whole, paraphyletic rather than monophyletic. Since tinamous are weak fliers, this raises interesting questions about the evolution of flightlessness in this group. If timamous are inside the ratite lineage, then ratites evolved flightlessness at least three times. Re-evolution of flight in the tinamous would be an alternative explanation, but that has no precedent in bird evolution, while loss of flight is commonplace.
Tinamous are ratites. Therefore, ratites are a group of medium to large birds, most of whom are flightless, with the exception of the tinamous. The ratites evolved flightlessness more than once. The similarities between Ostriches and the Australo-Pacific ratites is due to convergent evolution.

Hurricane Luis

Hurricane Luis was one of the most powerful storms of the very active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. Even though Luis was strong it was still only the second strongest storm in 1995, the strongest was Hurricane Opal. Hurricane Luis was the strongest storm to hit the Leeward Islands since Hurricane Hugo in 1989. From August 22 to September 1 Humberto, Iris, Jerry, Luis, and Karen were active at the same time. Most of the places damaged by Luis were damaged only a week earlier by Hurricane Iris, except for the United States and Newfoundland (Canada) and most of the islands would be damaged again less than two weeks later by Hurricane Marilyn.
The early stages of Luis's formation is track back to a tropical wave that moved off of Africa on August 26. The next day it became Tropical Depression Thirteen near Cape Verde. It reached Tropical Storm status on the 29th and was named Luis. It reached hurricane status on August 30 and reach category 4 strength on September 2. The next day Luis reached it's highest winds of 140 mph making it a Category 4. Luis continued west and crossed over Barbuda late on September 4. At this time Luis came very close to Antigua, St. Barthelemy, St. Martin and Anguilla. Luis turned northwest and while it was 150 miles to the north of Puerto Rico Luis weakened to a category 2 hurricane, after being a major hurricane for a week. Luis kept slowly weakening and headed to the northeast. While Luis was offshore of Newfoundland he caused a wave more than 98 feet tall. Luis made landfall in eastern Newfoundland on September 11 while a category 1. That same day Luis became extratropical and died near Greenland.
These were the places impacted by Hurricane Luis. Many of the Island Countries were affected by Hurricane Iris a week before; many would also be affected by Hurricane Marilyn only ten days later.
Luis caused a lot of damage in Antigua and Barbuda because it made landfall in that country. In Antigua about 50% of houses were either destroyed of damaged. In Barbuda nearly 70% of houses were either destroyed of damaged. The government of the country spent about $350 million in U.S. Dollars to fix the damage.
In Bermuda winds were reported up to 46 mph. However, there was no damage or people killed in Bermuda. On September 11 a ship called Queen Elizabeth 2 got caught in the 98 foot wave that Luis caused. The ship was not damaged but it arrived late in New York.
The only Providence in Canada affected by Luis was Newfoundland.
In Newfoundland, Luis killed one person and caused about $500,000 in damage. Luis dropped 2.4 to 4.7 inches of rain while it passed over Newfoundland on September 11.
In Dominica, larges waves from Hurricane Luis caused one fisherman to get killed. Hurricane Luis caused about $47 million in damage to the island nation.
St. Martin, a small island was hurt most by Luis. Luis did not strike St. Martin, but it was hurt most by Luis because he caused 9 people to get killed and $1.8 billion in damage.
In North Carolina, a U.S. state, a wave caused one person to get killed. Also, in New York, a wave washed under a house and later destroyed causing $1.9 million in damage.
In Guadeloupe, Luis killed one. In Saint Barthelemy, winds were recorded up to 155 mph. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, damages from Luis were at $197 million.
After Hurricane Luis many organizations and Governments donated money to help fix the damage on the affect islands. The largest donation was the Government of the Netherlands, which donated $15.2 million. 
When Tropical Depression Thirteen became Tropical Storm Luis on August 29, it marked the earliest date of a seasons 12th named storm. While Luis was becoming extratropical it sped up to nearly 65 mph, making it the third fastest traveling Atlantic hurricane. On September 11 when Luis caused that 98 foot wave it was the highest wave recorded from an Atlantic hurricane. Until 2004, when Hurricane Ivan may have caused a wave up to 130 feet.
The name Luis was retired in the spring of 1996. Luis was the first name retired since Andrew in 1992. Luis was also the first named storm starting with L to get its name retired. Luis is now only one of two L names to get retired, the other was Lili in 2002. In 2001 Lorenzo was used instead.

Mossman is a town in north Queensland, Australia. It is on the Mossman River. There are bout 1700 people living in Mossman. It was first called Mosman; the name was changed because there was a Sydney suburb called Mosman. Mossman is on the Captain Cook Highway, north of Cairns.
Mossman Gorge, a popular attraction in Daintree National Park, is located west of town. Sugar cane farming is a major crop around Mossman. The Mossman Central Mill is the only sugar mill in the area; turns the cane into sugar.
The Mossman area was served by 2 separate tram systems using 2 foot (610 mm) gauge tracks (width of track). The trams carried passengers and general goods, as well as sugar cane. These tramways were the first transport in the area, proper roads were built much later.
Mossman has 5 primary schools and one high school. Mossman was once part of the old Douglas Shire. It is now part of the Cairns Regional Council. Mossman has a number of sporting clubs such as the Mossman Sharks rugby league club and the Port Douglas Australian Rules Football club. Mossman has the cleanest water in Australia. It is free from chlorine and fluoride and comes straight from the Mossman Gorge.

Red-violet

Red-violet is a deep tone of rosy magenta. It may also be considered a reddish tone of purple or a bluish tone of rose.
On the old fashioned, now obsolete red-yellow-blue pigment color wheel (in which red, yellow, and blue were regarded as the primary colors and orange, green, and violet were regarded as the secondary colors), "red-violet" was a tertiary color between red and violet on the red-yellow-blue pigment color wheel and thus was the equivalent of pigment purple. The other tertiary colors on a red-yellow-blue (RYB) color wheel were called blue-violet, blue-green, yellow-green, yellow-orange, and red-orange.
The RYB color wheel is still often used to teach color to children.
It has been reported by ophthalmologists that those who have their lenses removed and replaced with clear plastic intraocular lenses can see partway into the ultraviolet and view electric purple (a tone of red-violet) on the spectrum beyond Violet because it has been shown that the retina has some ultraviolet sensitivity which is normally blocked by the natural lens. Presumably, tetrachromatic animals such as birds can also see this color on the spectrum. These observers able to see partially into the ultraviolet describe the color they can see beyond violet in the ultraviolet as a sort of lilac, that is, a reddish-violet (purple) color that is the color of the lilac flower. (Presumably this color that they see would be electric purple, since electric purple is a pure chroma on the color wheel and would presumably be the color we would see on the spectrum beyond violet if we could see into the ultraviolet.) 
Note: The spectrum colors can only be approximated on a computer screen but the colors shown below are a close approximation of the spectral colors red and violet, shown compared to the non-spectral color red-violet (a deep tone of the color magenta tending toward rose).

Candidiasis

Candidiasis, often called yeast infection or thrush, is a type of infectious disease. It is a fungal infection (mycosis). The disease is caused by any of the "Candida" species of yeast. "Candida albicans" is the most common species.
"Candida" yeasts are common in most people. The yeast is usually controlled in the body. When the yeast grows without control, an infection happens.
A weakened, unhealthy, or young immune system may allow candidiasis to develop. HIV/AIDS, cancer treatments, steroids, stress and not enough nutrients may cause candidiasis.
Antibiotic and steroid use are the most common reason for uncontrolled yeast. Antibiotic kills some bacteria, and changes the balance of microorganisms in the body. This may allow the yeast to multiply.
Esophageal candidiasis is an infection of the esophagus by "Candida albicans". The disease happens in unhealthy people. Sometimes people will get the infection when they are treated with chemotherapy. People with AIDS can also get this infection more often.
One sign of esophageal candidiasis is painful swallowing. Weight loss can happen when a person has esophageal candidiasis for a long time.
Oral candidiasis is a yeast infection of the mouth. It is located on the mucous membranes of the mouth. It is caused by "Candida albicans", "Candida glabrata" or "Candida tropicalis".
Candida may appear as thick white or cream-coloured areas on mucosal membranes. The infected mucosa of the mouth may look inflamed. In babies the condition is called thrush. For babies, it is usually painless and causes no pain. Adults may experience discomfort or burning sensation.
In healthy persons, candidiasis is usually a very small infection of the skin or mucous membranes. These areas include:
Candidiasis is a very common cause of vaginal irritation, or vaginitis. It can also occur on the penis or scrotum. In unhealthy patients, the "Candida" infection can affect the esophagus. It could get everywhere in the body. This would cause a much more serious health condition, a state called candidemia.

Graphics Processing Unit

A Graphics Processing Unit (short: GPU) is a processor whose task is calculating the graphical output for monitors. It is mostly used in computers and video game systems. The GPU can be put on the motherboard or on separate video cards.
Today, there are generally two types of images which GPU has to calculate, which is also called rendering. Most applications like the operating system’s desktop (except e.g. Windows Vista’s Aero Desktop) or office applications the GPU has to render two dimensional (2D) pictures. Modern GPUs are so powerful that there is no difference in 2D performance between low-cost and expensive GPUs.
The minor part of today’s applications use 3D pictures to simulate three-dimensionality. Examples for such applications are computer and video games or applications for design and technical construction (CAD). The 3D acceleration performance of GPUs differs greatly. Generally, more expensive GPUs can render faster than low-cost ones.
Today’s market leaders for GPUs are AMD (under the label of ATi), Intel and nVidia. There are some smaller manufacturers whose market share is rather small, e.g. Matrox and S3 Graphics. They are concentrating on niche products. Some of them have focused on research only instead of producing real products, e.g. PowerVR and XGI Technology Inc.
There were several manufacturers who were bought by larger competitors, like 3Dfx and 3Dlabs, or stopped their efforts, as research costs are very high. Examples are Cyrix, Tseng Labs, Trident Microsystems and OAK Technologies.
Other early pioneers, like Hercules, who were once one of the market leaders, concentrate to produce video boards based on GPUs from AMD or nVidia, nowadays.
The term GPU computing combines all tasks a GPU can calculate that go beyond simple calculation and output of pictures. It is also known under the term General Purpose Computation on Graphics Processing Unit. Tasks are calculation of physics, Artificial Intelligence or even acceleration of video and picture editing. One of the first applications to support GPU computing is Adobe’s Photoshop CS4. 
nVidia calls their attempt at GPU Computing CUDA. This is nVidia's interface for using their GPUs for general computing tasks. CUDA is based on the C programming language.
ATi is calling their attempt Stream. There were some earlier attempts under a different name prior to Stream’s release with ATi’s graphics driver “Catalyst 8.12” in December 2008.
S3 Graphics showed a first application for video editing which is accelerated by their latest GPUs. Yet, there is no information whether S3 Graphics will continue to increase their efforts in GPU computing.
The latest milestone in GPU computing was AMD’s announcement of a Super-Computer based on GPUs at the CES in January 2009. It will be built of more than a thousand GPUs and will have a computing power of one petaflop.
Early GPUs used Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) interface to communicate with the motherboard of a computer, a type of slot which is still used today for simple motherboard add-ons such as extra audio-processing cards or USB ports. As graphics cards became more powerful and graphics applications more demanding, a faster kind of interface called Advanced Graphics Port (AGP) was created and then PCIe x16 (PCI Express 16-lane) after it, the current overall standard. In 2008 PCIe 2.0 was introduced, doubling the speed of PCIe 1.0 and still working with older PCI Express interfaces.
PCI graphics cards will only work in PCI slots; AGP will only work in AGP slots. PCIe graphics cards will not function in PCI slots and PCI graphics cards will not function in PCIe slots. However, PCI Express 2.0 graphics cards will work in PCI Express x16 1.0 motherboard slots and vice-versa.
Multi-GPU Systems are computers which use more than one GPU. Generally this is used in high-end home computers to accelerate computer games, but there is also the ability to have one GPU rendering normal game scenes and one GPU calculating physics. This is currently supported by nVidia’s GPUs only and called PhysX. ATi and Intel have developed their own physics engine named Havok.
The first attempts in Multi-GPU Systems were done by 3Dfx, which was bought by nVidia later. Their Voodoo video cards, which were 3D only accelerators, could be hooked up to a second Voodoo video card to gain more performance. This was called SLi. Theoretically the performance would double, practically it increased far less, depending on the video game, which is still a problem in today’s Multi-GPU Systems. Later, 3Dfx built more than one GPU on one video card. It’s latest video card, the Voodoo 6, was based on four GPUs, but it was never released. However there exist several engineering samples of the Voodoo 6, mostly owned by collectors.
After nVidia bought 3Dfx, Multi-GPU Systems were dead for several years until nVidia came up with this idea again in 2004. As nVidia had bought all technologies and market names from 3Dfx, too, they simply used the name SLi again. Today’s SLi works with up to three video cards, which is called 3-way-SLi. There were also attempts with four cards, but this failed due to limitations in the DirectX9 API. Today’s DirectX10 API however would support this.
Despite the video cards, a SLi compatible motherboard is needed to build a SLi-System. Such motherboards have several PEG Slots (the successor to AGP, based on PCI-Express Technology) for more than one video card.
nVidia offers various Multi-GPU video cards, where two GPUs are built on one video card. These are often called Dual-GPU video cards and do not need a SLi compatible motherboard.
ATi’s Multi-GPU Technology is called Cross Fire. It works quite the same way, though there are fewer limitations for video card combinations. CrossFire was renamed as CrossFire X in 2007 to represent the possibility to combine more than two cards. Today, it is possible to have a CrossFire X system based on four video cards or two Dual-GPU cards.
Just like with SLi, there is the necessity for a CrossFire compatible motherboard in order to build a CrossFire System. One Dual-GPU video card from ATi does not necessarily need such a Crossfire compatible motherboard, however for two of them, it is needed.

I think it should be called the plain english Wikipedia. This is because the english in it isn't like "D is for dog" but it is easy to understand, unlike the normal English wikipedia.
What do you think?
But it makes it seem like it is for simple people

I was thinking about creating some articles about popular/notable websites. Are there any types of things I should try to stay away from when creating these? I realize that I shouldn't make the article sound like an advertisement for the website, and I know about keeping a NPoV, but are there any other things I have to be careful about when making these (ie. are there specific guidelines about website articles, what constitutes notability in this case, what types of references are acceptable, etc.)? Thanks!
Cheers, 19:30, 10 January 2009 (UTC)
Can someone please double check and then move it on to the main page? There are objections to what I did at . Apparently I'm not following the non-stated rules well. () 13:54, 11 January 2009 (UTC)
Hi everyone. I just wanted to tell you, I've started . Please feel free to join! 16:38, 11 January 2009 (UTC)
I don't know if I'm the only one that's getting this but I got a window popping up on my left saying "Sponsored results", why is this showing up, and how do i get rid of it, it's REALLY annoying.--    22:35, 11 January 2009 (UTC)
There will be significant collateral damage to deleting all WP: pages. See the header of Simple Talk for just one example. Every shortcut box will need to be updated and every 'What links here' from a WP: page will need to be changed. -- 21:23, 12 January 2009 (UTC)
No more Collateral damage. I just finished speaking to a few admins who more about this process and we didn't "actually" need to delete anything. From what I understand, it gets taken care of when the bug gets fixed. So, they have all been restored. 22:33, 12 January 2009 (UTC)
Hello community,
just wanted to let you know: RAID and 1997 Pacific hurricane season have been proposed to become Good Articles, and are up for vote . Nudity is up for to become a very good article. In the meantime, let me remind you, that the queues for Good and Very Good articles are emptying; we would be looking forward to new nominations as well.-- () 11:38, 13 January 2009 (UTC)
Hi all. I just reduced the time in between automatic archives from 7 days down to 4 days due to the fact that Simple Talk has reached about 97 kilobytes in length. I believe that this will help us start to archive some of these backlogged messages within a couple of days time. I would highly recommend that we allow the bot to archive the page to see if this amount of time between archives is definitely better than its' previous setting. Cheers, 21:17, 13 January 2009 (UTC)
The problem about automatic archiving is that some discussions posted on simple talk can range up to for more than 4 or 5 days, i.e., prolonged dicussions, debates, polls, difficulty in getting a consensus. Not all posts or discussions last for the same amount of time. While unimportant posts generally do take up space at simple talk, I somewhat disagree about lowering the automatic archive time from 7 days. -- 12:04, 14 January 2009 (UTC)

Hi there all! I have been struggling to get the article Romania up to GA status and nobody has really offered to help me shape it up so that it can make the GA cut and possibly the VGA cut (eventually). I really need some help because of how long the article is, so if you can help me get it up to GA status, that would be greatly appreciated! 
These are the things that need doing before Romania can go up for voting:
These are the things that need doing before I would feel comfortable with having it go for GA status. Is anyone willing to help me make Romania a GA? Please tell me what you are willing to do on so that we can coordinate between all of the things that still need to be done before it can go up for GA status. Thanks for reading this long message, 00:21, 12 January 2009 (UTC)
Why do we need to have bots creating our articles for us? Whatever happened to quality, not quantity? I'd much prefer to see us have a small amount of articles of good quality than thousands of short one sentence stubs, as many of these rivers and communes seem to be. Indeed, are all of these even notable?
Does anyone else agree with me on this point? In less than a month, our article count has risen by 10,000 articles. Fine, we move up the Wikipedia rankings, but is it really a good thing?
Please comment!
Quit the melodrama. :/ This is a discussion about whether the bot creations should stop. Dealing with the ones in existence requires a much more central discussion (if you haven't noticed, they take up quite a large percentage of ). Honestly, threatening deletion and waving IAR is as detrimental as going round and deleting random articles. Let's keep this on focus.  () 01:46, 14 January 2009 (UTC)
To help cut out the melodrama, I have decided to run a straw poll for this to help us reach concensus. Please !vote under the correct section and explain why you vote that way.
Ok all,
I feel that this should now be the last fix needed for a while, as I know everyone (myself included) is getting fed up of it.
We should also be able to handle further things via rather than ST.
Anyway, the link is - comments welcome, as usual.
Thanks,

I have been working on the translation of the week the Kingdom of Tungning. i have copied the "former country" template across from enwiki but it is not working properly (no real surprise). It is adding info into the category section of the page. It is alos giving a warning about not using the right info. Templates are not something I really understand yet. Could some one have a look at the problem and either fix it, or make a new template, or show me how to do it? Thanks -- () 10:03, 15 January 2009 (UTC)

Hello there community. There are some pages that I would like to transwiki from the en:WP because it would be much easier to do that then to have to make each part of the list of asteroids individually. I would like to ask the community if you would be alright with me requesting the import permission temporarily so that I can get those list of asteroid pages over here without much of a hassle. I have used the import tools on a test wiki before and on the Go Wiki, which is the Wikia Wiki that I started, so I do have experience in using the import function. However, I need community concensus before I can request the permission over on meta. 
Will you convert every article you import? 
Answer: Yes, I will fully convert every article that I import so that it complies with Simple English. 00:34, 12 January 2009 (UTC)
Will you not do any mass (by cat) imports?
Answer Besides the transwiking of the lists of asteroids (which will be some pages), I will not do any mass edits or imports. I will make sure that I only transwiki a few of the lists of asteroids at a time, though, so you don't have to worry about that because I know about the pitfalls that can befall people who import. 00:34, 12 January 2009 (UTC)
When you mass import the asteroids, will you immediately convert the *entire* import?
Answer The beauty of it is the fact that nothing needs changing between the lists of asteroids because it is just part of a table. I was going to use the import tool to import all of the pages like List of asteroids/1–100 and so on up to the finish line. Cheers, 00:51, 12 January 2009 (UTC)
Aside from rollbacker, account creater... do you hold any other restricted permissions foundation, or on a local wiki?
Answer No, I do not hold any other restricted permissions anywhere. I have rollback both on here and on the English Wikipedia. Other than that, I have no other restricted permissions. Cheers, 00:51, 12 January 2009 (UTC)
Strike for now, until I can do some fact checking. 21:28, 14 January 2009 (UTC)
The issue is fixed and I've successfully imported a couple of articles. () 21:08, 11 January 2009 (UTC)
Since the issue has been fixed, I am going to ask the community once again if they would let me have temporary access to the importer flag so that I can do some importation of some of those lists of asteroids ;). I need to have community concensus before I can request the permission on Meta.
I am therefore reopening my question to the community. Thanks, 23:42, 11 January 2009 (UTC)

I noticed that there isn't a very good picture (featured picture) process, and it seems to me that it would be a good idea to create one. Thoughts? () 21:12, 18 January 2009 (UTC)
We don't have enough participation for this. We barely have enough participation for PGA/VGA and at times, DYK. Adding another mainpage process is asking too much, too soon and for these reason, I don't think it should be implemented. Lets focus on what we do have, and work on what needs to be fixed first. When we have more editors, we can add new shiny things to the mainpage. 22:11, 18 January 2009 (UTC)
(unindenting) We are not Wikimedia Commons. This wiki also lags behind in progress with the current VGA project. There are very few users who show commitment to any of the wiki's on-going projects. I do not think the community is ready for such things. -- 03:35, 19 January 2009 (UTC)
No more Main Page sections, please. As Synergy says, we barely have enough participants for PGA, PVGA, and DYK. Thats enough for now. — () 06:47, 19 January 2009 (UTC)
Proposal withdrawn. If anyone wants to propose this again, go ahead. I don't even think there are enough active editors (whom participate inthese discussions) to make this worthwhile. () 03:14, 20 January 2009 (UTC)
We don't have any local oversighters for this project. The oversight policy is located at . I propose that we add this permission to our two most active checkusers, who have already identified themselves to the foundation.
The policy requires 70-80% approval with at least 25-30 editors supporting.
Just a note: At the time of this writing, a meta steward counted the local oversight log for 2008 and counted 16 actions for 5 events. () 02:55, 20 January 2009 (UTC)
I seem to remember there was a tag or something like that, that was put on some articles that a school class was working on to stop them from getting deleted before they were finished. This might be needed again - there is a Korean class making some pages which were deleted, one of the pages is Daeboreum. The group has just recreated the page. I have put a note on the talk page not to delete, not at least until they have finished it, then a decision could be made like any other page. Anyone remember the tag, or where I could find it? () 12:36, 21 January 2009 (UTC)
According to Djsasso, I am the "number 1 reason people don't edit here. Either this is just another one of his petty attacks on me, or it's true, and I'm damaging this project. If people don't want me here, I'm happy to leave, and let this project fail. 20:18, 17 January 2009 (UTC)
I don't think anyone should leave. Majorly has a reason to be upset at the comment. Djsasso should not have made that personal attack, and if continued, should be warned. A quick "Attack the argument, not the commenter" should suffice. () 20:41, 17 January 2009 (UTC)
Majorly shouldn't leave, neither should Djsasso. Majorly's entitled to say what he wants as long as it doesn't violate . Although, I think that Djsasso's comment was a little out of line. let's just forget it and worry about more important things. 23:47, 21 January 2009 (UTC)
Is an approved bot?--  22:21, 21 January 2009 (UTC)
Hello all, 
Nudity was recently up for vote as a VGA, but failed to make it. There were two main reasons why it failed:
This statement means that certain articles (even if they are well-written) can never get a VGA tag. One example for this is Berlin Wall (no, I do not want to propose it for VGA). The event is too recent to find good sources; events that young are not interesting to historians.
Keeping this in mind, I think we should come up with a guideline as to sourcing statements. I think the basic principles for this guideline should be:
Something else, that should perhaps be considered:
I realise that this is perhaps extremely hard to achieve given that recently a few articles were not promoted because they did not reach the minimal number of votes.
Anyway, comments welcome. -- () 16:30, 22 January 2009 (UTC)
Hi there all. Romania was promoted to GA status earlier today. Thanks for the hard work you guys put in Peterdownunder and Synergy :). 
Next, I have proposed Romania for VGA status. There are still things that need to be done before it can become a VGA. It would be very beneficial if someone could come up with a list of things that needs completion before Romania can become a VGA. Thanks, 16:40, 22 January 2009 (UTC)
Hi there all. Based upon how inactive I have found the Wikipedia:Proposed good articles page to be, I would like to ask the community about my proposal to lower the total amount of voters required from 5 named editors down to 4 or possibly even lower because of how inactive it has been. Looking back at the last couple of votes, there have been several articles that are good article status just by looking at them that failed to be promoted due to the fact that we don't have enough active voters in the GA process to attain the 5 votes required by the requirements. This has hampered our intentions of getting more articles promoted to GA/VGA status. 
Another proposed change that I would like to bring up is to leave the number of required voters at 5, but to make the votes last a period of 14 or 21 days instead of the 7 that we have it set at now. By making votes last longer, that gives more possibilities of more editors participating in the votes and a higher probability of articles passing the GA/VGA process.
Both of these proposals are up for debate and I would like to hear from the community about what they think about these two proposals. Thanks, 16:52, 22 January 2009 (UTC)
I would like to suggest we add a neutral vote section to , opinions?--  05:54, 17 January 2009 (UTC)
Hello all,
I just wanted to quickly clarify what oversight is, and why we do not really need it. Using oversight, special admins (called oversihters) can delete revisions of a page, so that they are no longer visible to other admins (as deleted edits). This may be useful for hiding things like "personal info". 
The reason why we do not need is is that over here, all admins are trusted by the community; drama among admins is unheard of (we had no admin demoted because of bad behavior, in recent times). We can therefore trust our admins to not reveal such information.
We therefore do not need oversight in this wiki.
All the best. -- () 22:22, 21 January 2009 (UTC)
We still need oversight per Wikimedia Foundation policy if personal info is published on a page. Also on request. 03:51, 23 January 2009 (UTC)

Hello all, I have something I really need to say. The adminship system and RfAs, at least here, are so pathetic. People keep failing RfAs, getting opposed, for totally false reasons. It's turned into a complete game. People fail because , because they haven't waited six months, because they are quote/unquote "not active enough," because there isn't enough need, etc, I could name tens more. Then we have users wanting to create a , where you need "6 months and 1,000+ edits." Whatever happened to it being "no big deal," and just some buttons for users to use who won't abuse them. For goodness' sakes, this is all pathetically a game. 02:33, 23 January 2009 (UTC)
(<-) Please note, that at the moment, adminship gives you the following, which you could not get otherwise:
In exchange for this, the community needs to trust you (no, this is not about an edit count). In order to trust you, the community expects that most of your edits are in the main, the template, or the category namespace (we are not here to talk, we want to make an encyclopedia). If you do not need these tools, don't bother with requesting adminship; you can be a perfectly respected editor, without these tools - heck, you do not even need an account. -- () 08:36, 23 January 2009 (UTC)
"Adminship is (and should be) NO BIG DEAL"!! When a user votes, they vote whether they can trust the user to handle sysop tools. Adminship is about trust. It is not a prize. If the community can't trust the user, then the person cannot be a sysop. Also if you fail an RfA, don't fret. Improve yourself and fix your weaknesses, and maybe you can succeed next time. Also all users don't need sysop tools to edit Wikipedia. You can still contribute without extra tools. Sysophood often only gives you more responsibilites. -- 03:12, 24 January 2009 (UTC)

1970 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1970 Atlantic hurricane season was the period of time in 1970 that tropical cyclones formed in Atlantic Ocean. It officially began on June 1, 1970, and it ended on November 30, 1970. Strong storms of 1970 include Hurricane Celia, which killed 20 and caused severe damage. Also, Tropical Storm Dorothy killed 51 people, most in Martinique.
These are the names of the tropical cyclones that formed in the season:
These are the names set aside for 1970. Names that weren't used are in .
After this season there was one name that got retired: Celia. In 1974, the name "Carmen" was used instead.

Gary Karr

Gary Karr (born 20 November 1941), is an American classical double bass virtuoso and teacher.
There were several double bass players in his family, but he did not meet them. He studied with several teachers. He went to the Juilliard School. In 1962 he became famous when he was a soloist in a nationally televised New York Philharmonic Young People's Concert, conducted by Leonard Bernstein. On that famous telecast, Karr performed "The Swan" from "Carnival of the Animals" by Camille Saint-Saëns.
Gary Karr has given performances in many parts of the world. He has published a number of books for learning to play the double bass. After 40 years as a concert artist he retired in 2001 to Victoria, British Columbia, where he lives with his dog Shin-Ju.
In 1967, Karr founded the International Society of Bassists (ISB), an organization which encourages the playing of the double bass all over the world. Every two years the ISB has a big international conference. 
Olga Koussevitzky, widow of the conductor and double bass player Serge Koussevitzky (1874-1951) heard Karr play when he was young, and gave him the beautiful Amati double bass made in 1611 which her husband had played. Karr later gave this double bass to the ISB so that double bassists world-wide could play on it. 
In 1984 the Karr Doublebass Foundation was established by Karr, which loans instruments to promising young double bassists to help them in their careers.

1996 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1996 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1996, and lasted until November 30, 1996. Tropical Cyclones can and have formed outside these dates but not in 1996, because Hurricane Marco ended on November 24. The 1996 Atlantic hurricane season was very active, but not as active as 1995, but it was more active then 1997.
Tropical Storm Arthur was the first tropical storm of the 1996 season. It started on June 17 in the Bahamas as Tropical Depression One. One became Tropical Storm Arthur late on June 19. Tropical Storm Arthur made landfall in Cape Lookout, North Carolina was a weak tropical storm. It moved to the east and went back into the Atlantic Ocean and died on June 21. Arthur killed no one and caused only $1 million in damage.
Hurricane Bertha was the first hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season. It started on July 5 near the Cape Verde Islands. On that same day it became Tropical Storm Bertha. By July 7 it became a hurricane, during that day it struck Antigua, and Sint Maarten. Bertha moved along the edges of the islands in the Bahamas. Hurricane Bertha made landfall in North Carolina on July 12 as a category 2 hurricane. It quickly got weaker and died on July 14 as it entered Canada. Bertha killed 9 people and caused $335 million in damage. 
Hurricane Cesar started off the coast of Venezuela on July 24, it was a tropical depression at this time. It slowly got stronger, becoming a tropical storm the next day and a hurricane by July 27. On July 28 it made landfall as a hurricane in Nicaragua. Cesar weakened to a tropical storm over land, but it reached the Pacific Ocean and later on it became Hurricane Douglas. Hurricane Cesar killed 77 people and caused $206 million in damage.
Hurricane Dolly started as Tropical Depression Four near Jamaica. It got stronger and it became Tropical Storm Dolly soon after. Tropical Storm Dolly became Hurricane Dolly just before it made landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula on August 20. It weakened over land and entered the southern Gulf of Mexico as a tropical depression. Dolly quickly got stronger again and became a tropical storm. Just before it made another landfall in Mexico, it became Hurricane Dolly again on August 23. The storm weakened a lot over Mexico and it died on August 26. It killed about 14 in Mexico.
Hurricane Edouard was the strongest hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season. It started as Tropical Depression Five near Cape Verde on August 19. Tropical Depression Five did not become Tropical Storm Edouard until August 22. By the next day it had gotten stronger and it was Hurricane Edouard at this point. 
Hurricane Edouard strengthened fast, peaking as a category 4 hurricane on from August 24 - 28. After this, it weakened slightly, back to a category 3 hurricane. It turned to the north and repeated this but did not again re-strengthen into a category 4 hurricane. On September 2, Hurricane Edouard passed only 90 miles to the south of Massachusetts. By the next day Hurricane Edouard had died. 
Edouard killed 2 people and caused around $3.5 million in damage.
Fran started on August 23 as Tropical Depression Six. It slowly got stronger because Hurricane Edouard was near it. The depression became Tropical Storm Fran on August 27. Fran became a hurricane on August 29, weakened back to a tropical storm on August 30, and became a hurricane again on August 31. Hurricane Fran did not get much stronger until it began on a track more to the north. By September 5, it made landfall in Cape Fear, North Carolina as a category 3 hurricane. It died on September 8. Fran caused the deaths of 26 people and caused $3.2 billion in damage.
On August 26, Tropical Depression Seven started. It slowly grew and became Tropical Storm Gustav. It headed northwest and did not get any stronger because of the large size of Hurricane Fran and wind shear. Wind shear also caused in to die on September 2.
Hortense started on September 3 as the eighth tropical depression in 1996 in the Atlantic. It slowly strengthened, becoming Tropical Storm Hortense on September 7, four days later. As a tropical storm, it passed into the Leeward Islands and entered the Caribbean Sea. Continuing to slowly strengthen, it became Hurricane Hortense on September 9. Hurricane Hortense made landfall on the southwestern part of Puerto Rico. This resulted in $155 million in damage and the deaths of 18 people. It also moved along the coast of Dominican Republic, which killed 3 people. 
It soon re-entered the Atlantic Ocean, and it quickly strengthened. By September 13, it had become a 140 miles per hour, category 4 hurricane. Hortense started moving faster, but weakened at the same time. Finally, by September 15 it had made another landfall in Nova Scotia. In Nova Scotia, there was $3 million in damage. Hurricane Hortense died on later on September 15.
Isidore started on September 24 a few hundred miles south of Cape Verde. It headed westward and later peaked as a category 3 hurricane. Hurricane Isidore began heading north after it became a category 3 hurricane. Isidore weakened and died on October 1. 
The 1996 Atlantic hurricane season had 4 tropical storms, 3 hurricane, 6 major hurricanes and 1 possible storm.
There were 8 unused names in 1996 they include:
In the spring of 1997 the following names got retired: Cesar, Fran, and Hortense.

Healesville Sanctuary

Healesville Sanctuary, or the Sir Colin MacKenzie Fauna Park, is a zoo at Healesville in Victoria. It only keeps animals that come from Australia. It has a history of breeding Australian animals. In 1943 it became the first zoo to breed a platypus. The only other zoo to have bred a platypus is Sydney's Taronga Zoo. It also helps by breeding the endangered Helmeted honeyeater. It is one of three zoos in Victoria run by Zoos Victoria; the others are the Melbourne Zoo and the Werribee Open Range Zoo.
The zoo is in a natural bush setting. Paths wind through different habitat areas with wallabies, wombats, dingoes, kangaroos, and over 200 Australian birds. There are tours, bird shows and information areas for visitors.
Dr Colin MacKenzie (knighted in 1929) set up the "Institute of Anatomical Research" in 1921. It was on of land which had been part of the Coranderrk Aboriginal Reserve. The Reserve was given to the Healesville Council in 1927. It became the "Sir Colin MacKenzie Sanctuary" in 1934. By 1947 the sanctuary had grown into a major tourist attraction and the management was taken over by the Victorian government.

Tropical Storm Barry (2007)

Tropical Storm Barry is a tropical cyclone that grew quickly. It made landfall on Florida in early June 2007. It was the second Atlantic named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. Barry formed in the Gulf of Mexico and moved toward the northeast, reaching top wind speeds of 60 mph (95 km/h). It then weakened and first reached land near Tampa Bay, Florida. Barry quickly weakened after wind shear blew away most of the thunderstorms. Barry moved up the East Coast of the United States and by June 5, it was taken over by a bigger storm.
Rain from Barry in the province of Pinar del Río, Cuba, hurt three people and damaged 55 houses. In Florida, Barry caused heavy rain in an area that had been in drought. Flooding and wet roads killed two people in traffic accidents. Rough seas killed one surfer in Pinellas County, Florida. In Florida and Georgia, the rain helped firefighters fight bad wildfires. Damage from the storm was minor.
On May 29, a weather system in the Yucatán Peninsula created a small area of thunderstorms over the Yucatán Channel. The thunderstorms got stronger near the weather system. By May 30, clouds from the area reached from Nicaragua to the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Another weather system, called a tropical wave, created a storm on May 30. The next day, a cyclone formed inside the system. The storm moved towards the north-northeast, and slowly gained strength. More thunderstorms formed near the center, and the system became a tropical depression. A tropical depression is a type of storm.
The depression developed an area of squalls (sudden, violent storms with wind and rain). A Hurricane Hunters airplane flew into the area to collect information about the cyclone. At the beginning, the tropical depression looked to be both a tropical and subtropical cyclone. On June 1, the National Hurricane Center named the storm "Tropical Storm Barry". Barry was now 235 miles (375 km) to the west of Key West, Florida. Barry moved quickly towards the north. On June 2, it reached its strongest with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h).
After Barry reached its highest strength, strong wind shear removed most of the thunderstorms from the tropical cyclone. The center of the system then increased in length, and it began to weaken. At 1400 UTC on June 2, Barry made landfall near Tampa, Florida while it was at tropical depression status. As Barry moved inland, it weakened more. Later that day, the National Hurricane Center said that Barry had died out over northeastern Florida. What was left of Barry continued to move northeast. On June 3, it moved onto shore again, this time in South Carolina. Late on June 4, the extratropical system entered New England. Late on June 5, what was left of the cyclone was taken over by a larger weather system, near the border of the U.S. state of Maine and the Canadian province of Quebec.
When Barry was named as a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center sent out a tropical storm warning for the west coast of Florida from Bonita Beach through Keaton Beach. Also, a tropical storm watch was issued from Keaton Beach, northward to Saint Marks. An inland tropical storm warning was also sent out for inland parts of Charlotte, Citrus, DeSoto, Hardee, Hernando, Highlands, Lee, Levy, Manatee, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Sarasota, and Sumter counties. The storm increased the risk of rip currents, so officials told swimmers to stay out of the water until the storm left the area. A tornado watch was sent out for the southern part of the state, but it was removed after the storm lost strength.
After becoming an extratropical cyclone, National Weather Service offices sent out flood watches for parts of: South Carolina, eastern North Carolina, southeastern Virginia, and southeastern Maryland.
Flood watches were also sent out for: southeast Pennsylvania, northern Delaware, northern New Jersey, east-central New York, southern New England. 
A wind advisory was sent out for parts of Georgia.
Barry caused heavy rain in Florida, the most rain being 6.99 inches (178 mm) at Palm Beach International Airport. Other areas reported over 3 inches (75 mm) of rain. The rain helped to get rid of drought conditions. It also helped in fighting bad wildfires across the state. In Brevard County, the rain caused a large sinkhole, a hole in the ground, to open in the middle of a road. Other roads were flooded. On Interstate 95, near Lake Worth, another sinkhole closed two lanes of traffic. Wet slippery roads caused many traffic accidents in the state. In Brevard and Volusia counties, drivers were killed in traffic accidents. On Interstate 4, a tractor trailer crashed into a guardrail because of the weather.
The storm caused stormy seas along the coastline of Florida, with a storm surge of 4.78 feet (1.46 m) at Clearwater Beach. The waves caused minor beach erosion. The high surge also caused minor flooding on many roads near Tampa Bay. At Indian Shores, a woman died after being injured by the high seas.
Barry caused high winds in Florida, which reached 47 mph (76 km/h), near the southeastern coastline of the state. The winds knocked down trees and caused power failures. In Carrolwood, one person was injured when a tree crashed onto their house. The storm created at least two tornadoes, including some that damaged fences and power lines. One possible tornado in Goulds, Florida left about 2,000 people without power.
The storm also caused heavy rain in Georgia of up to 8 inches (203 mm). The rain helped put out wildfires. It also caused some minor flooding, and in Savannah, there were a few minor car accidents. Winds blew down some trees and power lines. Heavy rain from the storm moved across much of the East Coast of the United States. High winds also occurred in South Carolina.
The remains of Barry caused strong winds along the Atlantic coast. They reached 60 mph (97 km/h) near Charleston, South Carolina. Around 200 houses in Craven County, North Carolina lost power. In southeastern Virginia, the storm caused over 60 traffic accidents. Ten people were injured in them. High seas off Cape Fear left a sailboat with three people needing rescue from the Coast Guard.
Rain went north into the Mid-Atlantic States and New England, with 4.50 inches (113 mm) at Absecon, New Jersey, 3.91 inches (99 mm) near Central Park, New York, and 3.19 inches (81 mm) at Taunton, Massachusetts. Several roads and driveways were damaged by flooding in the Finger Lakes region of New York State. Flash floods were seen in southeast New York, and high wind gusts caused some damage to trees. In New Jersey, winds pushing over land caused high tides and minor coastal flooding.

2009 Atlantic hurricane season

The 2009 Atlantic hurricane season was a time period of 2009 when tropical cyclones were likely form in the Atlantic Ocean. The season started on June 1, 2009 and it ended on November 30, 2009. In this season Tropical Depression One formed early, on May 28. In June and July there were no storms. The most recent occurrence of no storms in June or July was in 1992. In total there were 2 tropical depressions, 7 tropical storms, 3 hurricanes, and two of the three were major hurricanes.
On May 28, a small storm formed off the coast of North Carolina and became a tropical depression, called "One" by the National Hurricane Center. The National Hurricane Center said that Tropical Depression One might strengthen into a tropical storm, but it did not because the water was cold and did not give enough energy to the storm. It weakened and stopped being a depression the next day.
Tropical Depression Two formed on August 11 south of Cape Verde. The system moved west and dissipated on August 13. On August 15 the remains of Tropical Depression Two reformed. Tropical Depression Two quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Ana. The storm continued west towards the Leeward Islands. A few days later as the storm was still headed for the Leeward Islands it weakened to a tropical depression. Ana struck Dominica on August 16 and dissipated the next day.
On August 15, Tropical Depression Three formed and quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Bill. On August 17 Tropical Storm Bill became Hurricane Bill. On August 18 Hurricane Bill became a major hurricane (Category 3+). Hurricane Bill quickly strengthened into a category 4 hurricane on August 19, but weakened back on to a category 3 on August 20. Hurricane Bill weakened to a category 2 on August 21, it again weakened the next day to a category 1 hurricane. As a category one hurricane Bill came close to a landfall in Nova Scotia. Near midnight (Eastern Time Zone) on August 23, Bill made landfall in Newfoundland and became extratropical the next day. The remains affected United Kingdom.
Tropical Storm Claudette formed in the Gulf of Mexico as Tropical Depression Four early on August 16. At 12:15 p.m. EDT the same day, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Claudette. Early the next morning Claudette struck Santa Rosa Island, Florida. Tropical Storm Claudette weakened and dissipated on August 18.
Tropical Storm Danny formed north of Puerto Rico on August 26. Danny top winds were at 60 mph. Danny did not become a hurricane. Danny instead, moved toward North Carolina as a weak tropical storm. On August 29 Danny weaken into a depression and lost it clouds to an extratropical storm. Danny did not reach North Carolina before losing its cloud. Danny killed a boy in North Carolina due to rip currents.
Tropical Storm Erika formed on September 1 as Tropical Storm Erika, meaning it was never a tropical depression. Tropical Storm Erika moved mostly west for most of the lifespan of it. On September 2 Tropical Storm Erika made landfall in Guadeloupe. Tropical Storm Erika weaken to a tropical depression and a remnant low on September 3. The remnant low caused some rain to some of the northern islands of the Caribbean Sea.
Tropical Depression Seven formed on September 7 south of the Cape Verde Islands. Later on September 7 it became a tropical storm and was named Fred. Early the next day, Tropical Storm Fred became Hurricane Fred, the second hurricane of the season. Hurricane Fred became a major hurricane (Cat 3+). Fred slowly weakened after becoming a category 3 hurricane. On September 12 while a tropical storm, Fred became a remnant low and is no longer a tropical storm.
Tropical Depression Eight formed near Cape Verde on September 25. Tropical Depression Eight was said that it would become a tropical storm, this did not happen. Tropical Depression Eight instead became a tropical wave on September 26. It is no longer a tropical depression.
Tropical Storm Grace became a tropical storm late on October 4, it was also never a tropical depression while it was forming. Tropical Storm Grace moved towards Ireland, but went into a frontal system on October 5, Grace was not a tropical storm anymore. The remains affect Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Tropical Storm Henri was a weak storm that stayed out in the ocean for most of its life. It formed from a tropical wave on October 6 while moving northwest across the Atlantic. On the next day, wind shear around the storm caused it to weaken into a remnant low. Its remains were last seen near Cuba. The storm did not come close to any land and did not cause any damage to property.
On November 4, Tropical Depression Eleven started in the Caribbean Sea. Later that same day it became a tropical storm and was given the name "Ida". Ida became a hurricane just before landfall on November 5. Ida weakened fast over land and was a depression before the end of the day. On November 6, Ida came back into the Caribbean Sea just north of Honduras. Ida became a tropical storm again on November 7. Ida later on became a hurricane again and weakened back to a tropical storm on November 9. Ida made landfall in Alabama on November 10. The storm died only about 4 hours later. The remains of Ida became a nor'easter that killed 9 people. Hurricane Ida also caused about $5.6 million in damage.
The following names will be used for named storms that form in the North Atlantic in 2009. This is the same list that was used in the 2003 season, except for "Fred", "Ida", and "Joaquin". In 2003 those three names were Fabian, Isabel, and Juan, because they were bad storms in 2003, their names were retired from the list of names.

Tropical Depression Seven (2003)

Tropical Depression Seven was a weak tropical depression that formed near the northeast Florida coast. It was the seventh tropical cyclone of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. The depression formed on July 25 from the same tropical wave that created another weather system. It was a small and disorganized depression, and it never became a tropical storm, which is stronger than a tropical depression. The depression moved onto land at St. Catherines Island, Georgia, and it quickly weakened. Because the storm was weak, the effects were limited to heavy rain in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
A tropical wave, which had also created Tropical Depression Six, combined itself with an upper-level low pressure area to create an area of deep convection near Hispaniola on July 23, 2003. A mid- to lower-level circulation started to form inside the storm as it moved mostly in a north-northwest direction. According to surface and satellite observations, it is thought that the system became Tropical Depression Seven at 1200 UTC on July 25 about 60 miles (95 km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida. The system was caught in an environment characterized by high surface pressures.
At first, the depression moved west-northwest at about 13 mph (20 km/h), and most of the convection from the storm was separated from the center. However, the cloud pattern became organized, and was made up of a number of curved banding features. The storm continued to move northwestward for its whole life, from the steering currents of a subtropical ridge and an approaching mid-level trough.
Moving through an area of cool water temperatures, as well as unfavorable upper-level winds, the depression was not able to get winds greater than 35 mph (55 km/h), and as a result did not gain tropical storm status. Before landfall, the highest winds were measured to exist in a small area northeast of the center of circulation, where a well-defined group of clouds persisted. Early on July 26, it moved onto land on St. Catherines Island, Georgia, and after slowly weakening over land, it died out on July 27.
The depression was never predicted to become tropical storm status. Because of this, no tropical storm warnings or watches were issued. However, flood watches were issued for part of Georgia and South Carolina. At Georgetown County, South Carolina, officials watched the storm closely. 
The depression dropped light to moderate rain from Florida to the coast of North Carolina. The highest rain was 5.17 inches (131 mm) in Savannah, Georgia. Other rainfall totals of 2 to 3 in (50 to 75 mm) were common. There were no damages or casualties because of this depression.

Wikipedia:Simple News/Bluegoblin7/Articles/3

One of the things that most Wikipedians aim for is to achieve at least one "Good Article" and/or at least one "Very Good Article". We have a very good process here at the "Simple English Wikipedia", but its main fallback is that there are not enough active users nominating and !voting for the articles.
In the closing days of 2008 both of our processes were several weeks out of date due to no interest. did a very good job of trying to revive the process, and it is now running fairly smoothly.
However, many of the candidates are still being declined due to a lack of !votes. Good Articles (or "GAs") need to have a minimum of 5 !votes, and Very Good Articles (or "VGAs") need to have 6 !votes. There are also percentage requirements.
The majority of the GA and VGA candidates currently at !voting do not meet these criteria, and are due to close on the 20th January. Many are up to their respective standards but do not have enough !votes to allow them to gain the titles that are rightly theirs.
Another issue is articles that are being turned away because they are being nominated but no-one is acting on the comments raised in the nomination. The (V)GA processes require lots of community input to help get the articles up to their relevant standards, and the reward of having your article on the Main Page (in the case of VGA) pays for all the hard work that you would have put in.
Finally, we need more people to actually nominate articles that are eligible! We are going to run out of VGA candidates in a couple of weeks, and GA candidates soon after.
So, how can you help? Well, head over to or and give your thoughts, or go write some articles and nominate them! As I have said it is a very time consuming but rewarding process.
I've added my GA nomination.. have you?

The season officially started on June 1, 2001, and it ended on November 30, 2001. This time period is when tropical cyclones usually form in the Atlantic Ocean.
Tropical Storm Allison was the costliest tropical storm in United States history. Allison caused so much damage because she moved very slow over Texas. It took Allison about 4 days to move from Lufkin, Texas to the Gulf of Mexico. Allison left $5.5 billion in damage and killed 55 people. 
Tropical Depression Two formed on July 11. Forecasters said that it might become a tropical storm. This did not happen. Tropical Depression Two died on July 12. 
Barry formed as Tropical Depression Two on August 2. It later became Tropical Storm Barry. Barry moved west and weakened to a tropical depression and made a loop at the same time. Barry became a Tropical Storm again and made landfall in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida on August 6. Barry was last seen in Missouri. Barry killed 9 and left $30 million in damage. 
Chantal started from Tropical Depression Three on August 14. Tropical Depression Three weakened into a wave and was no longer a depression. It reformed but as a tropical storm it was given the name Chantal. Chantal crossed the rest of the Caribbean Sea and made landfall in Belize. Chantal died over Mexico on August 22. Chantal killed 2 people and caused $4 million in damage.
Dean formed on August 22, it skipped becoming a tropical depression. Dean weakened and became a tropical wave and then reformed. It died on again on August 28 when a low that was not a tropical wave took over the storm. Dean left $7.7 million damage in Puerto Rico and Dean did not killed anyone.

The depression continued to strengthen, and became Hurricane Felix by September 13. Now moving north, Felix intensified rapidly, reaching Category 3 status. Felix turned to the northeast and started to weaken. By September 17, Felix had dropped to tropical storm strength, and it died on the 19th. No damage was reported.

On November 2 Michelle became a hurricane. The hurricane strengthened very fast and was a category 4 by the next day. Michelle struck Cuba and the Bahamas twice before it started dying on November 5. The dying storm completely died a little bit south of Bermuda. Michelle killed 17 and left $2 billion in damage. 
Hurricane Noel was a short-lived hurricane that started as a subtropical storm. On November 5 it became Hurricane Noel. Noel died the next day without affecting land badly. The remains caused high winds and waves in eastern Canada. No one was killed and there was no damage. 
Olga started on November 24 as a subtropical storm. It quickly became a tropical storm. On November 26 it became Hurricane Olga. Olga later on weakened and finally died on December 6. Olga had no affect on land.

This is the same list that was used for the 1995 season except for Lorenzo, Michelle, Olga, and Rebekah. Lorenzo, Michelle, and Olga were used for the first time in 2001. Names that were set aside for the 2001 season, but were not used, are marked in . 
The World Meteorological Organization retired three names because of their damage: Allison, Iris, and Michelle. These names were replaced in the 2007 season by Andrea, Ingrid, and Melissa. Allison the first Atlantic "tropical storm" to have its name retired.

<doc id="161632" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161632" title="Methane hydrate">
Methane hydrate

Methane hydrate, also called methane ice or methane clathrate, consists of methane, which is enclosed in frozen water. The water molecules completely surround the methane. Methane hydrate is a common constituent of the shallow marine (ocean) geosphere. In 1971, it was first discovered in Black Sea.
Methane hydrate is often described as “methane gas surrounded by ice.” Although this description is easy to understand, it's not completely accurate. A more accurate description would be that methane hydrate consists of "methane gas trapped inside cage-like crystal structures made up of water molecules." These “cages” have a size of atoms and molecules, far too small to see with the naked eye. Under normal temperature and pressure, one litre methane hydrate is equal to 168 litres methane gas.
Methane hydrate is thought to be formed by dead organic matter trapped between the earth's layers, and then broken down by microorganisms and the earth's heat. The process is similar to the one that produces methane when organic waste is dumped at a garbage pit and covered with earth, except that it occurs deep below the earth's surface. The organisms which produce methane by a process of fermentation are the methanogen Archaea.
Areas where natural methane hydrate is thought to exist are generally areas under the ocean where continental plates meet. In depths between 500 to 1000 meter, where pressure is high and temperature low enough.

Grand Olympic Auditorium

The Grand Olympic Auditorium is the old name of a sports arena in Los Angeles, California, United States, located at 1801 S. Grand Avenue. It was built in 1924 for the 1932 Summer Olympics. The boxing, weightlifting, and wrestling events were held there. At the time it was the largest indoor venue in the U.S with seats for around 10,500. It opened on August 5, 1925, and famous people like boxer Jack Dempsey and silent film actor Rudolph Valentino were there.
In the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s it was home to some of the biggest boxing, wrestling and roller derby events.
The 1960s and 1970s were a major boom period for the Olympic Auditorium, as major wrestling events were held at the arena every other Friday night. It was the home of the T-Birds, who played a game called "Roller Derby". In the late 1980s it was changed and 3,000 seats were taken out, leaving space for about 7,500.
Some scenes from the movie "Rocky" were filmed there.
In June 2005, the Glory Church of Jesus Christ, a Korean-American Christian church, bought the entire property and changed the name. In 2007, the arena was painted brown like it used to be.

Hydrography

Hydrography is a subject of Geography. It concerns itself with measuring the physical characteristics of waters, such as rivers, lakes and oceans. It can also be about such measurement in navigable waters, as they are necessary for the safe passage of ships and vessels.
Massive hydrographical studies are usually undertaken by national or international organizations that sponsor data collection through surveys and publication of charts and descriptive materials for navigational purposes. 
Hydrography's origin lies in the making of chart like drawings and notations made by individual mariners. It was usually a private property, even closely held secrets, used for commercial or military advantage.

Tibor Sekelj

Tibor Sekelj (in Hungarian: "Székely Tibor") (14 February 1912 – 20 September 1988) was an explorer, writer and lawyer. He traveled a lot in South America, Africa and Asia. He spoke many languages, including Esperanto, the made up international language. He was member of the Academy of Esperanto and honorary member of the Universal Association of Esperanto (UEA). He wrote books in Esperanto. He came from a Jewish family.
Sekelj was born in Spišská Sobota, which was then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It is now called Poprad, in Slovakia. His father was a veterinarian (animal doctor), and the family moved around extensively. They moved to Cheney, now in Romania. In 1922 they moved to Kikinda, Serbia. He went to elementary school in Kikinda. The family moved to Nikšić, in Montenegro where he finished high school. He went to Zagreb where he studied in law at university.
Disinterested in practicing law, he began working as a journalist in Zagreb. In 1939 he went to Argentina to write about former Croates who had left Yugoslavia to settle in South America. He stayed there for the next 15 years as a journalist and explorer. In 1944 he was part of a trekking party that climbed to the top of highest mountain in the western hemisphere Aconcagua , near Argentina. He used this experience to write a novel (story) in Spanish about Aconcagua, which became a best seller there. In 1946 he undertook the first of two expeditions into the Amazon jungle, the first of which produced a popular book, (Por Tierra De Indios}. His companion from that expedition, Mary Reznik--whom he later married--was the first white woman to have penetrated that deeply into the Brazilian jungle. Together they returned to the Amazon in 1948, after which he penned "Where Civilization Ends" (Donde La Civilizacion Termina). The marriage produced a son, Diego. In 1954 Sekelj returned to Yugoslavia and settled in Belgrade, although he still traveled extensively. In 1962 he traveled through Africa. He married Erzsebet Sekelj, a young woman he met on a trip through Hungary. From 1972 he lived in Subotica (Vojvodina), now in Serbia. He was in charge of a museum in Subotica. He died in Subotica, and is buried there.
During his travels in South America, Africa, Asia, Oceania, Sekelj collected many important items from other cultures. He gave these to the Ethnographic Museum of Zagreb.
His main book on other cultures is " Tirez the arrow: oral poetry of the world ", Rotterdam: UEA, 1983, 187 pages, ISBN 92-9017-025-5. He translated into Esperanto, the poetry he had collected during his travels.
Sekelj worked with many other writers on a dictionary of museums, called the "Dictionarium Museologicum", 1986.

<doc id="161720" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161720" title="Tapestry">
Tapestry

Tapestry is art made with threads. It is woven by hand on a vertical loom. It is weft-faced weaving. This means all the warp threads (the ones that go up and down) are hidden in the completed work. In normal cloth weaving both the warp and the weft threads can be seen. 
In this way, a colourful pattern or image is made. Most weavers use a natural warp thread such as linen or cotton. The weft threads, which will be seen, are usually wool or cotton. They can also be made of silk, gold, silver, or other things.
Both craftsmen and artists have made tapestries. The 'blueprints' on cardboard (also known as 'tapestry cartoons') were made by artists, while actual weaving of the tapestries was done by craftsmen.
The success of decorative tapestry can be partially explained by its portability (Le Corbusier once called tapestries "nomadic murals"). Kings and noblemen could roll up and transport tapestries from one residence to another. In churches, they were displayed on special occasions. Tapestries were also draped on the walls of castles for insulation during winter, as well as for decorative display.

Peppered moth

The Peppered moth ("Biston betularia") is a species of night-flying moth. They are often used by educators as an example of natural selection: they have two forms, one is dark and one is light. The story of their evolution is told on Peppered moth evolution.

Peppered moth evolution

The evolution of the peppered moth has been studied in detail over the last 150 years. At first, almost all of the moths were light coloured. This gave them camouflage against the light-coloured trees and lichens where they rested during the day. As pollution increased during the Industrial Revolution in England, many of the lichens died out. The trees became blackened by soot, and most of the light-coloured moths, or typica, became rare. At the same time, the dark-coloured, or "melanic", moths, carbonaria, flourished. This change took place because it was the best camouflaged moths which survived better. The term industrial melanism refers to the genetic darkening of species in response to pollutants. 
Since then, with an improved environment, light-coloured peppered moths have again become common. As a result of the relatively simple and easy-to-understand circumstances of the adaptation, the peppered moth has become a common example used in explaining or demonstrating natural selection.
Melanism has appeared in the European and North American peppered moth populations. Information about the initial rise in melanic frequency is scarce. Much more is known about the subsequent fall in phenotype frequency, because it was measured with moth traps.
A black peppered moth was found in 1811, a rareity, no doubt caused by a gene mutation. By 1864 the darker 'carbonaria' form was the more common morph in Manchester. By 1895, it reached a frequency of 98% in Manchester.
From around 1962 to the present, the phenotype frequency of "carbonaria" has steadily fallen. Its decline has been measured more accurately than its rise, because of better scientific studies. Bernard Kettlewell conducted a national survey in 1956, Bruce Grant conducted a similar one in early 1996, and L.M. Cook in 2003.
Similar results were found in America. Melanic forms have not been found in Japan. This may be because peppered moths in Japan do not live in industrialised regions.
In 1896 J. W. Tutt suggested that the increased proportion of "carbonaria" was caused by differential bird predation. This meant birds took more light-coloured moths in dark areas, and more dark-coloured moths in light areas. Various experiments have been performed on predation of the peppered moth, and each has supported this hypothesis.
The most famous experiments on the peppered moth were carried out by Bernard Kettlewell under the supervision of E.B. Ford. In one of Kettlewell's experiments, moths were released into a large (18 m by 6 m) aviary, where they were fed on by Great Tits ("Parus major"). In 1953, Kettlewell experimented at Cadbury Nature Reserve in Birmingham. He marked, released and recaptured the marked moths. He found, in polluted woodland, more "typica" morphs were taken. This showed that the melanistic phenotype was important to the survival of peppered moths in such a habitat. Kettlewell repeated the experiment in 1955 in an unpolluted woodland in Dorset, and again in polluted woods in Birmingham. He was accompanied by Niko Tinbergen, and they made a film of this. Further studies by others found similar results. Finally, in 1996, work on both sides of the Atlantic found a correlation between changes in melanic frequencies and pollution levels.
A field experiment in biology will always have some artificiality, but that has to be balanced against practicality and costs. The most important aspect is that an experiment gives useful information. The only previous experiments of this type were R.A. Fisher and E.B. Ford's with the Scarlet tiger moth.
In 2000 Majerus developed plans for further experiments. In the main experiment in Cambridge from 20012007 Majerus added an experiment to find if bat predation might have skewed the results – this found that bats preyed equally on both forms of the moth. He observed a number bird species preying on the moths. The overall data led him to conclude that differential bird predation was a major factor responsible for the decline in "carbonaria" frequency compared to "typica" in Cambridge during the study period. He described his results as a complete vindication of the peppered moth story, and said "If the rise and fall of the peppered moth is one of the most visually impacting and easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action, it should be taught. It provides after all the proof of evolution". Majerus died before he could complete the writing up of his experiments, but the work was carried on by others. The paper said that "These data provide the most direct evidence yet to implicate camouflage and bird predation as the overriding explanation for the rise and fall of melanism in moths". The new data, coupled with the weight of previous data show that "industrial melanism in the peppered moth is still one of the clearest and most easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action".
"Biston betularia" caterpillars also occur in two forms, each adapted to a different situation. They develop body colours which match the brown or green twigs of their host plant. This is done by a mechanism called polyphenism. Polyphenism is a kind of polymorphism where different forms of an animal are caused by the same genome. The animal inherits the capability, but the environment determines which form develops. This contrasts with genetic polymorphism of the adults, where each morph (form) inherits a slightly different genome.
Polyphenism occurs when the animal inherits a developmental switch. The switch is sensitive to some environmental cue or trigger. In this case, researchers discovered that visual experience triggered precise color matching.

The Ditrysia are a natural group or clade of insects in the Lepidopteran order containing both butterflies and moths. They are so named because the female has two distinct sexual openings: one for mating, and the other for laying eggs. About 98% of described species of Lepidoptera belong to Ditrysia. The group can be divided into basal or "incertae sedis" "micromoths" and the Apoditrysia which includes mostly larger moths as well as the butterflies.

Nyssa (Doctor Who)

Nyssa is a fictional character in the long-running British science fiction television series "Doctor Who". She is played by Sarah Sutton. Nyssa came from the planet Traken. Nyssa was created by writer Johnny Byrne for the Fourth Doctor serial "The Keeper of Traken", but the production team later decided that she should join the Doctor on his travels. She returned in the next serial "Logopolis", in which the Fourth Doctor regenerated, and remained as a companion of the Fifth Doctor. She was a regular in the programme from 1981 to 1983. Sutton was the youngest female actor to play a companion in the series.
Nyssa is a alien from the planet Traken, the daughter of Tremas (a consul of the Traken Union) and stepdaughter of Kassia. She helps the Doctor and Adric to defeat Master. During her journeys with Tegan and Adric aboard the TARDIS, Nyssa finds herself trapped in a mathematical equation by the Master – whom she hates as he is, of course, now using "that face" (her father's). She also encounters a race of androids and their insane ruler, helps foil the genocidal plans of a wounded Terileptil and incidentally start the Great Fire of London, and discovers her remarkable resemblance to Ann Talbot.
Nyssa's fate after she leaves the TARDIS is not known, although the spin-off novel "Asylum", by Peter Darvill-Evans, reveals that she eventually leaves Terminus and settles down as an academic in a university on an unspecified planet. In "Asylum", Nyssa shares an adventure with the Fourth Doctor from a time before he met her, leaving the Doctor with the knowledge that he will have to be extremely careful dealing with Nyssa when they eventually meet to avoid changing history.
Since then, Sutton has also voiced Nyssa in several audio plays alongside Peter Davison as the Fifth Doctor, produced by Big Finish Productions.

Harry Sullivan (Doctor Who)

Harry Sullivan is a fictional character from the British science-fiction television series "Doctor Who". He was a companion of the Fourth Doctor. Harry Sullivan was played by Ian Marter, the character appears as a regular during the programme's twelfth season in 1974–1975.
Harry is a doctor in the Royal Navy, who is also a medical officer to the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce, the military organisation to which the Doctor works for as a scientific advisor. He is first mentioned (though not seen) in "Planet of the Spiders", when the Brigadier thinks the Third Doctor has gone into a coma. The Brigadier calls "Doctor Sullivan" and asks him to come to the Doctor's laboratory, but tells him not to bother when Sergeant Benton wakes the Doctor by offering him a cup of coffee. In the next serial, "Robot", after the Doctor's third regeneration, Sullivan is called in to help him, and ends up travelling aboard the TARDIS with the Fourth Doctor and Sarah-Jane Smith (played by Elisabeth Sladen) for several adventures. 
The character was originally devised by the production team to do any action scenes required in episodes when they had envisioned that the new Doctor would be played by an older actor (Sarah-Jane even jokingly compares Harry to James Bond at one point). When forty year-old Tom Baker was cast, however, this was no longer a concern and the decision was taken to write Harry out — something producer Philip Hinchcliffe later admitted was probably a mistake, as Harry was a likeable and popular character who worked well with both of his fellow leads. 
Harry's last regular appearance is in the season thirteen opener "Terror of the Zygons", which had actually been made at the conclusion of the twelfth production block and held over to start the following season. At the conclusion of this story he chooses to return to London by train rather than by TARDIS with the Doctor and Sarah-Jane, who continue their adventures without him. He does, however, reappear three stories later in "The Android Invasion", both as the original Harry and an android double. This is the character's final appearance in the programme.
A photo of Harry can be seen in Sarah-Jane Smith's attic in "The Sarah-Jane Adventures" and in "Invasion of the Bane", Sarah-Jane thought of naming her newly adopted son after him before deciding on Luke.

Fire drill

A fire drill is a sudden practice event, where people leave a building. They are practicing what they would do if there was a fire in the building. The event is started when a fire alarm sounder or bell keeps on sounding. The entire building is evacuated and everybody leaves the building using the nearest fire exit. At a school, college or university, the teacher or the lecturer counts the people outside to find out if anyone is missing. Sometimes people are evacuated for no reason. This is called a false alarm. 
In the United Kingdom, the law says that all schools must do a fire drill at the start of the academic year in September, and suggests that one should occur every term. Also, regular health and safety checks such as testing fire alarm systems and fire extinguishers must be done weekly. In the United States, different states have laws that say how often schools must have fire drills. For example, in many states, schools must have one fire drill per month.
Fire drills commonly take place in schools, colleges and public companies. In public transport such as cruise ships, it is called a muster drill. Fire drills aren't done on airplanes, but a safety demonstration that shows the emergency procedures of the aircraft is done instead. If an aircraft is about to perform an emergency landing, the passangers on the aircraft are told to take the safety brace position on hearing the "brace" command.
During fire drills, some schools block exits with a piece of cardboard or something else that is supposed to stand for a fire. This makes people practice finding another way out of the building.

Fire alarm

A fire alarm is a an electronic sounder or a bell. The sounder makes a loud high pitched sound to alert people that there is a fire in the building. The sounders can be programmed to sound different tones. Most fire alarm sounders in Europe sound like a siren. The bell makes a continuous ringing sound. Some companies that make fire alarms are Wheelock and Simplex. There is also Fulleon who are best known for their Roshni electronic sounder. These sounders are often used around Europe and they have 32 user selectable tones. Sometimes, old-fashioned fire alarms are metal bells.. Many fire alarm systems also have flashing lights. These are important for deaf people who cannot hear the fire alarm.
Fire alarms are often used in schools and other places during fire drills. If somebody sets off a fire alarm without a good reason, it is called a "false alarm". Setting off a false alarm is against the law almost everywhere.

Yehudi Menuhin

Yehudi Menuhin, Baron Menuhin, OM, KBE (born New York, 22 April 1916; died Berlin 12 March 1999) was a violinist and conductor. As a child he was one of the most amazing violin prodigies there has ever been. He was one of the greatest violinists of the 20th century. In later life he also performed a lot as conductor. He was a very influential teacher who started a school, the Yehudi Menuhin School, near London, for musically gifted children. He was born an American citizen, but then became Swiss in 1970, and then took on British nationality in 1985.
Yehudi Menuhin was born in New York City, New York. His parents were Russian Jews who came from what is now Belarus. His sisters were Hephzibah Menuhin who became a pianist, and Yaltah Menuhin who became a pianist, painter and poet. His father, Moshe Menuhin, had been a rabbinical student and anti-Zionist writer.
Menuhin had his first violin lessons just after the age of four in San Francisco with the violin teacher Sigmund Anker. He immediately showed extraordinary talent. He continued to study with Louis Persinger, and performed with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra in 1924. and in New York in 1926. He performed in Paris in February 1927, after which he studied with the Romanian composer and violinist George Enescu. When he played Beethoven’s Violin Concerto with the conductor Fritz Busch in New York in November 1927 he immediately became world famous. He not only had the most amazing technique but he also understood the music just as well as any grown up musician. As a child he made many recordings. One of the most remarkable was a recording made in 1932 of Elgar’s Violin concerto. Elgar, who was then 75 years old, was conducting the orchestra.
During World War II Menuhin gave more than 500 performances for American and allied soldiers. He was the first person to perform in the Paris Opéra after the war and he went with the composer Benjamin Britten to perform for the people who were prisoners in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, after they were made free in April 1945. He returned to Germany in 1947 to perform with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra with the conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler. Many Jews said he should not have done this, because they said that Furtwängler had played for the Nazis who had killed so many Jews, but Menuhin said it was the right thing to do.
Menuhin continued to give many performances, but there were times when he did not play so well. He may have worked too hard. He had to give himself time off performing and he practised very carefully and studied meditation and yoga to help him get over his problems.
Menuhin continued to perform until he was quite old. He did not just play classical music but explored other kinds of music such as jazz which he often played with the famous jazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli, and he explored Indian music and played with the sitarist Ravi Shankar. He also conducted some of the world’s greatest orchestras and founded his own chamber orchestra.
In 1959 Menuhin made his home in London. He performed a lot in England, including at the Bath Festival, but also continued to travel all over the world.
In 1962 he started a school for children who had special musical talent. It was called the Yehudi Menuhin School. The school is in Stoke d'Abernon, Surrey, just south of London.
In 1983 he founded together with Robert Masters the Yehudi Menuhin International Competition for Young Violinists. Many of today’s famous violinists won prizes at this competition, including Tasmin Little and Nikolaj Znaider.
In 1991 he was given the Wolf Prize by the Israeli Government. In the Israeli Knesset he gave a speech in which he criticised Israel's occupation of the West Bank. He said that it was not right for the Jews, who have lived by strict moral behaviour for 5000 years, not to let others (meaning the Palestinians) live their lives there too.
Menuhin had many pupils who became famous, including Nigel Kennedy. 
Yehudi Menuhin was married twice. He first married Nola Nicholas, daughter of an Australian industrialist, and sister of Hephzibah Menuhin's first husband. They had two children. After their divorce, he married the British ballerina and actress Diana Gould. They had two sons, Gerard and Jeremy, who became a pianist. 
The name "Yehudi" means 'Jew' in Hebrew. It means "Thanks to God".
Yehudi Menuhin was given many honours from all over the world. These include the Commander of the Legion d’honneur, a Knight of the Dutch Order of Oranje Nassau, an Hon. KBE, and the Nehru Award for International Understanding. In 1993 he was made a life peer and became Lord Menuhin.
Lord Menuhin died in Berlin, Germany, from bronchitis. 
Soon after his death, the Royal Academy of Music was given the Yehudi Menuhin Archive, a very large collection of musical books, letters etc. that had belonged to Yehudi Menuhin.

The Yehudi Menuhin School is a private music school in Cobham, Surrey, England. It was started in 1963 by the violinist Yehudi Menuhin.
The school is very small: there are about sixty pupils who are boys and girls between the ages of eight and nineteen. The children must have extremely good musical talent. They all play at least one musical instrument: either a stringed instrument or piano. They are taught other subjects as well, but music is the most important subject, and they are given lots of time to practise their instrument as well as music lessons to help them develop their special musical skills in classical music. Famous musicians who were pupils at the school include Nicola Benedetti, Nigel Kennedy, Tasmin Little and Alina Ibragimova.
Ofsted rate the school as 'outstanding'.

Recipe

A recipe is a list of instructions that shows how to prepare or make something such as a food dish. 
Modern-day recipes are usually made up of several parts:
Recipes from earlier times often included much less information: Older recipes usually just reminded a person of the ingredients needed.
The earliest known recipes are from 1600 and came from an Akkadian tablet from southern Babylonia. The ancient Egyptians painted hieroglyphics showing the preparation of food. Many recipes are known from ancient Greece. Mithaecus's cookbook was an early one, but most of it has been lost. Athenaeus quotes one short recipe in his Deipnosophistae. Roman recipes are known with some of them starting in the 2nd century B.C with Cato the Elder's De Agri Cultura. Many other authors of this period explained eastern Mediterranean cooking in Greek and Latin.
King Richard II of England asked someone to make a recipe book called "Forme of Cury" in 1390. Around the same time another book was published entitled "Curye on Inglish". Both books give an idea of how food was made and served in the noble classes of England at that time. 
By the 1400s, manuscripts appeared, describing the recipes of that time. Many of these give very good information and record the re-discovery of many herbs and spices including coriander, parsley, basil and rosemary. Many of these herbs and spices had been brought back from the Crusades.
During the 1500s and 1600s, printed books appeared. The large houses tried to be better than each other, and books were written on how to manage households and prepare food. In Holland, and England, the noble families competed to see who could make the most splendid foods. 
By the 1660s cooks published their own books explaining their recipes, in competition with their rivals. Many of these books have now been translated and can be found online.
In Europe, none had such influence as the top French chefs. They built the haute cuisine which others copied. La Varenne (1615–1678), Carême (1784–1833) and Escoffier (1846–1935) were the great innovators.
By the 1800s, cooking had become a hobby throughout the world. Using the newest technology and using a new publishing idea, Mrs Beeton (1836–1865) published her famous ‘Book of Household Management’, in 24 parts between 1857 and 1861. Around that same time the American cook Fannie Farmer (1857–1915) devoted herself to cooking. She published the book ‘The Boston Cooking School Cookbook’ in 1896 which had 1849 recipes.
The next revolution in popular culture came with introduction of the media cooks. The first was Philip Harben who was first on radio, with newspaper columns and books. Then he was first on British television, before Fanny Craddock.
TV cooking programs brought the recipes of cooks to a new audience who wanted to try out new ways of cooking. In the early days, the recipes were available by post from the BBC and later with the introduction of the CEEFAX text on screen system, they became available on the television. The new companies of Channel 4 and S4C also brought recipes to the television with their own text system called ORACLE. Today the television is still a major source of recipe information, with world-wide cooks and chefs such as Julia Child, Jamie Oliver, Nigella Lawson and Rachael Ray having TV shows and websites giving the details of all their recipes.

Pygmalion effect

Pygmalion was a sculptor who lived in Cyprus. Women who lived on Cyprus didn't stay virtuous, so Pygmalion decided to live alone and made a sculpture, Galatea. During the Aphrodite feast, thanks to Pygmalion`s prayers, the sculpture turned into a real person. This was called The Pygmalion effect.
The Pygmalion effect shows that if we want something enough, we'll get it. It is named after the scholar who demonstrated it. It is also called "Rosenthal Effect" and is quoted when we refer to "The power of affirmation" and "The power of praise".
Another example of the Pygmalion effect is in groups. If there are two groups, one group thought that their teacher was "good", the other group thought he was "not good". The teacher treated both groups the same, but the group with a positive expectations had better outcomes than the others; Simply because those with positive expectations made them perform better than other students.
The Pygmalion effect is also an important instrument in management theory. It makes managers be aware, that the success of their employees depends not only on qualification, personal qualities or working environment. Manager always has to believe in his people and expect them to achieve the best results. In such case the subordinates will always feel this trust and demonstrate their best skills and abilities in their work.

Jet lag

Jet lag is a physiological condition, often occurring when humans travel from one time zone to another. It happens because of the time difference between two places. Some people suffer from jet lag more than other people do.
If the departure time (the original body clock) is not the same as the destination time, jet lag can occur. Traveling east is more likely to cause jet lag than traveling west. That is because a cycle of the human's biological time is usually more than 24 hours, and going east makes the day shorter, which is a more difficult adjustment.
Jet lag can have several symptoms. It usually takes the form of fatigue and insomnia. Also, headache, depression, even nausea may strike people. Sufferers can use caffeine or sleeping pills as a way of treatment.

Korean International Circuit

The Korean International Circuit is a racetrack being made in Yeongam County, South Jeolla Province, of South Korea. This is 400 kilometres from the capital, Seoul. This track will be 5.684 km long. This will be the longest track in Asia. The main purpose of this track will be Formula One (F1) races. F1 will race at this track for at least 7 years starting in 2010. It will also be used for local races.
Charlie Whiting, technical delegate for the FIA completed a two-day inspection on 10 October 2010. While much of the circuit facilities are still under construction, the circuit itself is ready for Formula One racing.
Special attention was given to the top layer of asphalt. This final layer was installed the week before the inspection.
FIA rules normally require approval at least 90 days before the race. The FIA had to stretch their own rules to allow the Korean Grand Prix to take place.
German designer Hermann Tilke designed the track. The track has two parts. One permanent part (3.047 km) will be used for local races. One temporary part (2.643 km) will be joined to the permanent part and be used for F1 races. The track has 18 corners. The track will be next to a lake, so some people will be able to see the races from their boats.
A number of problems were uncovered on the first day of practice. Drivers complained about the blind entrance to the pit lane. Jarno Trulli called it "very dangerous". A number of cars have bottomed out at turn 16. Charlie Whiting has asked that the corner be changed. The track was slippery and dusty. Lewis Hamilton said "It was the dirtiest circuit I have ever been on," and "It was so dusty it was incredible." The problems with the turn 16 was fixed before the qualifying session the next day.

Dangun

In Korean mythology, Dangun was the grandson of the gods, and the founder of Gojoseon, who set up the capital at Asadal. Legends say that around 4,340 years ago, "Joseon" was the name of the country that became Korea. So Dangun is believed to be an ancestor of the Korean nation. There was also a kingdom called "Joseon" later in Korean history, so Dangun's kingdom is called "Go" (meaning "Ancient") Joseon.
Once upon a time, Hwanung, the god Hwanin`s son, wanted to go down to the human world. Hwanin noticed that and let Hwanung go down to the human world with three amulets. Hwanung went to the Sindansu in Mount Taebaek, with his 3,000 followers. He managed the human world`s agriculture, morals, and 363 other fields of societal work. All these things went well.
One day, two animals visited Hwanung, begging him to change them to human beings. One was a tiger, and the other was a bear. Hwanung gave them an armful of divine wormwood and twenty cloves of divine garlic, and said: "Eat those for 100 days without being exposed to the sunshine. Then you will become human beings."
The two animals went to the cave and followed Hwanung`s orders. But during this process, the tiger could not endure this trial, and rushed out from the cave. On the other hand, the bear endured the trial and became a woman. But nobody was willing to marry her. So the bear woman prayed to conceive a baby at Sindansu. Then Hwanung transformed himself into human being for a while and married her. The bear woman gave birth to a baby. That baby was Dangun.
Dangun managed Gojoseon for 1,500 years, and after that long period, Giza succeeded to the throne. Dangun retired from the world and became a mountain god.

Yi Sun-sin

Admiral Yi Sun-sin was born in Geoncheon-dong, Seoul, Josun dynasty(Ancient name of Korea) on March 8, 1545. Owing to the poverty of his family, he moved to and grew up in his mother's hometown, Asan, in Chungcheongnam-do province. He became a warrior at the late age of 32, after failing the exam at the age of 28. When he arrived Jeolla-do province as the navy commander of western part of Jeolla-do province in 1591, he predicted the war with Japan. He disciplined the navy tightly and made the turtle ship, which had at least five different types of cannon and had a fully covered deck with iron spikes to shield from cannon fire and attempt to board the ship, for preparation of the war.
On April 13, 1592, the Imjin War broke out just as Yi had foreseen. Japan occupied nearly all the land of Josun dynasty which was not prepared for war and tried to supply military provisions through the sea route of Jeolla-do province. Yi had already prepared for war, so he led his navy to victory in every engagement he fought during seven years of war with the Japanese. In the battle of Hansan, using 'crane wing' formation he captured and sank fifty nine of the seventy-three Japanese ships. And in the battle of Myongnyang, he defeated 333 enemy ships with 13 ships his own. This victory has regarded as one of the miracle victories of the world.
Through his victories, Josun dynasty prohibited the Japanese warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi from governing Josun. However Yi Sun-sin was killed by enemy fire during the last battle of the war, Noryang, in 1592.

But in June 512, ruler Lee Sa Bu conquered the Usan-guk. In the early 1000's, Japanese called Ulleungdo Uruma. Tribute was continued during the Goryeo. In the early 11 century, after the Usan-guk people who was attacked by Yeojin ran away to the mainland, Ulleungdo and Dokdo became direct controlled territory of the Goryeo. In march 1407, the ruler of Tsushima Island sent envoy, presented the local products and sent back the victims for getting a approval that ruler of Tsushima Island administered the Ulleungdo. But the king of Chosun, Tae Jong, rejected it. In the formal term of Chosun, there were a lot of damages because of Japanese's plunder.

The drill itself has to be completed before the ship leaves. Muster drills are not required on ferries, but safety announcements are made before the ferry departs. There was a rule where life jackets were needed to be warn at the drill but there has been some changes to the rules and most cruise liners do not require life jackets at the drill. 
Before a muster drill starts, the captain announces over a loud speaker 30 minutes before, 15 minutes before and when the emergency alarm signal is about be sounded.

It was the 13th named storm, 9th hurricane, and 6th strong hurricane of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. Lane began from a tropical wave on September 13, while it was to the south of Mexico. It moved towards the northwest along Mexico, and it quickly gained strength. After turning towards the northeast, Lane reached its peak winds of 125 mph (205 km/h), and it made landfall in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. It quickly weakened and died out on September 17
Near its path, Lane caused four deaths. The damage was worst in Sinaloa. In that area, crops were badly damaged. Moderate flooding happened in Acapulco, which caused mudslides in some areas. Damage in the country totaled to $2.2 billion (2006 MXN, $203 million (2006 USD).

Paraceratherium

Paraceratherium is an extinct genus of mammal, a large hornless rhinoceros. It lived in Eurasia during the late Oligocene epoch of the Tertiary period, (34–23 million years ago).
"Paraceratherium" is one of the largest land mammal known. Its exact size is unclear because of the incompleteness of the fossils. The size of adults was about tall, about in length. Estimates of its weight have varied greatly. 
It was a herbivore that stripped leaves from trees. It had a long, low, hornless skull and long frontal and nasal bones. Its front teeth had a single pair of incisors in either jaw. They were round, pointed, and so large that they looked like small tusks. The upper incisors pointed straight downwards, while the lower ones jutted outwards. The upper lip was evidently extremely mobile. The neck was very long, the body big and strong, and the limbs long and thick, column-like.
Its exact size is unclear because of the incompleteness of the fossils. Estimates have been based on skull, teeth, and limb bone measurements. However, the known bone elements are from individuals of different sizes. All skeletal reconstructions are composite extrapolations. This resulted in weight estimates from 11 to 20 tonnes. Its maximum height has been estimated as at the shoulders. Its length was around from front to back. As explained, such figure are only approximations. These figures are of the largest of the three species in the genus.

Tropical Storm Aletta (2006)

Tropical Storm Aletta was the first tropical cyclone in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. Aletta began from a weather system that was located to the south-southwest of the Mexican port of Acapulco, Guerrero. It slowly got stronger, and it was named as a tropical depression early on May 27. Aletta became a tropical storm later that morning. The storm moved very slowly, but it later turned to the west and weakened on May 29. Aletta kept weakening weakening until it died out on May 31. The storm dropped rain along the coast of Mexican. It also caused winds that knocked down trees and caused minor damage.

1978 January subtropical storm

Subtropical Storm One gave the 1978 Huricane season a very early start when it became the only Atlantic cyclone to form in the month of January, after it had formed on January 18. It dissipated on the 23rd causing no damage to land and only threatening land briefly. There were two storm in the month of January but they formed in December, they were: Hurricane Alice in 1954 and Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005. Since 1978 there has never another Tropical or Subtropical cyclone to form in the month of January. 
Because there was no naming system for Subtropical Storms at the time, this was called Subtropical Storm One, had it been given a name it would be "Subtropical Storm Amelia".

Berlin Philharmonic

The Berlin Philharmonic (in German: Die Berliner Philharmoniker), is an orchestra from Berlin, Germany. It is one of the greatest orchestras in the world. The conductor of the orchestra is Sir Simon Rattle.
The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra was founded in Berlin in the spring of 1882. By 1887 they were known by their present name. Hans von Bülow became their conductor that year and made them into a world class orchestra. Other great conductors were also invited to conduct as guests: Hans Richter, Felix von Weingartner, Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler, Johannes Brahms and Edvard Grieg. 
In 1895, Arthur Nikisch became chief conductor, and was followed in 1923 by Wilhelm Furtwängler. The orchestra continued to perform throughout World War II. After Furtwängler fled to Switzerland in 1945, Leo Borchard became chief conductor, but a few months later he was accidentally shot and killed by American forces occupying Berlin. Sergiu Celibidache then took over as chief conductor for seven years, from 1945 to1952. Furtwängler returned in 1952 and conducted the orchestra until his death in 1954.
Herbert von Karajan led the orchestra from 1955 until he resigned in April 1989. He was a very strict conductor who had to be obeyed in everything he did. The orchestra made lots of great recordings with him. 
After Karajan, Claudio Abbado became principal conductor. He helped the orchestra to learn new works, not just the well known classical and romantic works but also the more modern 20th century works. He stopped conducting the Berlin Philharmonic in 2002. At the time Germany was being reunited the orchestra had financial problems.
In June 1999, the musicians chose Sir Simon Rattle as their next chief conductor. Rattle made the orchestra into a self-governing body. This meant that they made their own financial decisions and chose the works they would perform and who would be invited to perform with them. 
The first concert hall of the orchestra was destroyed during WWII in 1944. Since 1963, the orchestra has had a new concert hall called the Philharmonie. On 20 May 2008, a fire broke out at the Philharmonie. A quarter of the roof was damaged and the orchestra could not play there for some time.
The orchestra have won many awards for their playing.
UNICEF appointed the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and Sir Simon Rattle as Goodwill Ambassadors in November 2007.
On 18 December 2008 the Orchestra announced that a Digital Concert Hall would be built. This new internet platform will allow music fans all over the world to see and hear the Philharmonic’s concerts – live or on demand.

RNA virus

RNA viruses are viruses that use RNA as their genetic material. In humans, well-known RNA viruses are those that cause SARS, Influenza or Hepatitis C.
Viruses that are not RNA viruses use DNA for their genome and are called DNA viruses.
Viruses have a classification system, invented by David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize winner. The RNA viruses in the Baltimore system are classified as:
"Sense" in RNA means "ready to make proteins, as messenger RNA does". "Antisense" in RNA means "complementary to messenger RNA". In complete complementarity each nucleotide is across from its opposite number, so antisense RNA can produce sense RNA. 
Another system is run by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). It uses terms from the familiar Linnaean taxonomy, like orders and families.
RNA viruses have very high mutation rates compared to DNA viruses. This is because viral RNA polymerases lack the proof-reading ability of DNA polymerases. This explains why it is difficult to make effective vaccines to prevent diseases caused by RNA viruses.
Some genes of RNA virus are important to the viral replication cycles and mutations are not tolerated. For example, the bit of the hepatitis C virus genome which encodes the core protein is highly conserved, because it is essential to start translation.

Mydoom

The Mydoom virus (also known as a worm and as Win32.Mydoom.A) was a very damaging computer virus that affected Microsoft Windows-based computers. The worm was spread through mass emailing, as badly sent email. 
The virus was made to be sent in an email with an attachment that carried the virus. When the attachment was opened, the virus would itself to the computer. The virus can only affect Windows based computers. The virus came with a package that would spam the SCO Group website. SCO had caused arguments within the Linux community for getting copyrights in some open source software. However, only 25% of the infected computers would launch the attack. After the virus has been downloaded, it leaves the computer open to other malware by leaving a "backdoor" open.
Another type of the virus, Mydoom.B, was made to spam Microsoft. It was first found on January 28, 2004.
The virus was found to be a threat on January 26, 2004. The virus quickly spread and proved a threat to the SCO group. To try and get the public to catch the maker of the virus, the SCO group offered $250,000 U.S. dollars as a reward for catching the creator. Another type of the virus, Mydoom.B was found on January 28. Because it was made to attack the Microsoft web site, Microsoft offered a $250,000 U.S. dollar reward if the maker of the virus was caught. This was the third time Microsoft offered a reward for catching a virus creator.
On February 1, 2004, the virus downed the SCO group site with many denial-of-service attacks. On February 3 the virus attacked the Microsoft site and little damage was caused.
Mydoom caused many problems during its lifespan in 2004. It caused web speeds to slow by about 50%. At the peak of the infection, Mydoom made for one in twelve emails sent.

Hurricane Nate (2005)

Hurricane Nate was an Atlantic hurricane that formed in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It came close to Bermuda, but it stayed at sea. Nate was the 14th named storm and 7th hurricane of the 2005 season. It formed to the southwest of Bermuda on September 5. It then moved very slowly to the northeast, and it passed to the south of Bermuda. The storm then moved into colder waters, and it began to weaken. Nate was later absorbed by a larger weather system.
The storm caused no damage because it stayed at sea. However, one person was killed from rip currents that were caused by the storm. Nate caused light rainfall and gusty winds on Bermuda. Canadian Navy ships that were carrying supplies to help people in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina were slowed down because of Nate.

Chromalveolate

Chromalveolata is a eukaryote supergroup first proposed by Thomas Cavalier-Smith as a refinement of his kingdom Chromista, which was first proposed in 1981.
The origin of the Chromalveolata was thought to be a secondary endosymbiosis between a bikont (cell with two flagella) and a red alga. This union led to plastids containing chlorophyll c. In Cavalier-Smith's classification, the Chromalveolata was one of the six major groups within the eukaryotes.
The classification has been challenged.

Hurricane Irene (2005)

Hurricane Irene was an Atlantic hurricane that formed in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm formed near the Cape Verde Islands on August 4. It moved across the Atlantic Ocean, and it turned northward around Bermuda. The storm lost its name as a tropical cyclone to the southeast of Newfoundland. Irene lasted for 14 days as a tropical system. That is the longest time of any storm of the 2005 season. 
Irene was a hard storm to forecast. The storm almost died out on August 10, but it gained back its strength. Irene reached Category 2 hurricane strength on August 16. Because the storm stayed far away from land, no tropical cyclone warnings were declared. Also, Irene did not cause any bad damage. However, it caused strong waves along the East Coast of the United States. Because of the waves from Irene, a 16-year-old boy drowned after being caught in a rip current near Long Beach, New York. Lifeguards at one beach made over 100 rescues. The name "Irene" is expected to be used again in 2011.

Ciliate

The ciliates are a group of protists characterized by the presence of hair-like organelles called cilia, which are identical in structure to flagella but typically shorter and present in much larger numbers with a different undulating pattern than flagella. Cilia occur in all members of the group (although the peculiar suctoria only have them for part of the life-cycle) and are variously used in swimming, crawling, attachment, feeding, and sensation.

Apicomplexa

The Apicomplexa are a large group of protists (protozoa) which are parasitic. They have developed some extraordinary adaptations which fit them in their parasitic life. They are all single-celled, they are all parasites of animals, and they all form spores.
They have a unique organelle, a plastid called an apicoplast, and an apical complex structure which gets them into a host's cell. They do not have structures such as flagella or pseudopods except in certain gamete stages. Body movement is by flexing or gliding.
The group were once called the Sporozoa, but this name is now discouraged.
Apicomplexans have complex life cycles, and there is much variation among different apicomplexan groups. Both asexual and sexual reproduction occur. Cell nuclei are haploid.
This is a diverse group including organisms such as coccidia, gregarines, piroplasms, haemogregarines, and malarias. Diseases caused by apicomplexan organisms include:
Most members have a complex life-cycle, with both asexual and sexual reproduction. A host is infected by an active invasion by the parasites. The parasites divide to produce "sporozoites" which enter its cells. Eventually, the cells burst, releasing "merozoites", which infect new cells. Eventually, gametes are produced, and they fuse to create new cysts. There are many variations on this basic pattern, however, and many Apicomplexa have more than one host.
The apical complex includes vesicles which open at the front of the cell. They secrete enzymes that allow the parasite to enter other cells. The tip is surrounded by a band of microtubules, called the "polar ring", and among the Conoidasida there is also a funnel of tubulin proteins called the "conoid". 
The presence of alveoli and other traits place the Apicomplexa among a group called the alveolates. Several related flagellates, such as "Perkinsus" and "Colpodella", have structures similar to the polar ring and were formerly included here, but most appear to be closer relatives of the dinoflagellates. They are probably similar to the common ancestor of the two groups.
Another similarity is that many apicomplexan cells contain a single plastid, called the apicoplast, surrounded by either 3 or four membranes. Its functions are thought to include tasks such as lipid and haem biosynthesis. It appears to be necessary for survival. The plastids are thought to have a common origin with the chloroplasts of dinoflagellates, and evidence points to an origin from red algae rather than green.

David Rosenhan

David L. Rosenhan (1929 – February 6, 2012) was an American psychologist. He was best known for the Rosenhan experiment. This was a study which looked at how valid psychiatry diagnoses were.
Rosenhan got his Bachelor of Arts degree from Yeshiva University. At Columbia University in 1953 he earned his master's degree. Five years later, he earned a Ph.D in psychology. Rosenhan was an expert on psychology and law. 
In 1973 Rosenhan published "On Being Sane in Insane Places". This was one of the most-read pieces of writing in psychology. The article talks about the Rosenhan experiment. The experiment was that eight people with no history of psychopathology would try to get into twelve psychiatric hospitals. All of these people were allowed in, and were diagnosed with either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Psychiatrists then tried to cure the people using psychiatric medicines. All eight were allowed to leave within 7 to 52 days, but only when they had said that they accepted the illness they had been diagnosed with. Later in the study, a research and teaching hospital challenged Rosenhan to run a similar experiment with its own diagnoses and rules for letting people in to the hospital. Psychiatric staff were warned that at least one pseudo-patient might be sent to their hospital. At least one staff member thought that 83 out of the 193 new patients were actors. In fact, Rosenhan sent no actors. The study showed that the ways diagnosis was done was very inaccurate in telling people with mental disorders and people without mental disorders apart. The paper made a lot of controversy. Some people are not sure of how valid and credible the study was, but say that psychiatric diagnoses need to be improved.
Professor Rosenhan worked with the Stanford University Department of Psychology. Later, he became professor emeritus at Stanford University. He died on February 6, 2012, aged 82.

Giant magnetoresistance

Giant magnetoresistance (GMR) is a very small magnetic effect found in thin layers of iron and other materials. It is used to read and write information in hard drives.
The GMR effect can be measured when a magnet is used to change the flow of electricity. The 2007 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to Albert Fert and Peter Grünberg for the discovery of GMR.
GMR was discovered in layers iron, chrome and ferrite by Peter Grünbergs research team of the Jülich Research Centre (Germany) in 1988. Peter Grünberg owns a patent for the technology. It was also discovered by Albert Ferts research group of the University of Paris-Sud (France) in layers ferrite and chrome. The Fert group were first to see what they thought of as a "large" effect which is why they gave the name "Giant". The Fert group were also first to explain the correct physics of GMR. The discovery was the beginning of the science spintronics. Grünberg and Fert have been given prizes and awards, including the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics, for this discovery and other spintronics work.
In multilayer GMR, two or more magnetic layers are separated by a very thin (about 1 nm) non-magnetic (insulating) layer. Ferrite, a form of iron, is a magnetic layer and chrome is an insulating layer. At certain thickness, the strength of magnetism between the layers becomes easy to measure and adjust. The strength of electrical current between the layers can change by up to 10%.
The GMR effect was first observed in stacks of 10 or more layers.
In spin valve GMR, two magnetic layers are separated by a thin (~3 nm) non-magnetic (insulating) layer. It is possible to measure and adjust the strength of magnetism between these layers.
It is hoped that research into spinning electrons will improve spin valves. 
Materials used in spin valves are copper and an alloy of nickel and iron. 
Spin valve GMR is the most useful sort for hard drives and is tested carefully to meet industry standards.
Granular GMR is an effect found in copper containing grains of cobalt. It is not possible to control the strength of granular GMR in the same manner as Multilayer GMR.
GMR is used in modern hard drives and magnetic sensors. Another use of the GMR effect is in magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM). GMR has begun a new science of electronics called spintronics.

Link reaction

The Link reaction, also known as pyruvate decarboxylation or the Swanson Conversion, forms an important link between the metabolic pathways of glycolysis and the citric acid or Krebs cycle.
In eukaryotes, the reaction takes place only inside the mitochondrial matrix; in prokaryotes similar reactions take place in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane.
To summarise:
Acetyl CoA is then ready for use in the Krebs Cycle.
The Link reaction is important as acetyl-CoA is needed for the Krebs cycle to happen.

Rift (geology)

In geology, a rift is caused by tectonic plates in the Earth's lithosphere moving apart. Rifts are usually accompanied by orogeny (mountain building), volcanoes and earthquakes. The Great Rift Valley in East Africa is an example.
A rift is the result of the pulling apart or extension of the crust and lithosphere. Mantle upwelling brings hotter asthenosphere up into the colder lithosphere. This rise occurs with the thinning and stretching of the lithosphere.

Yo-Yo Ma

Yo-Yo Ma (born 7 October 1955) is a French-born Chinese American cellist. His family name is “Ma”, so his full Chinese name is “Ma Yo-yo”. Yo-Yo Ma is one of the world’s greatest cellists. He plays many kinds of music, not just classical, and he has performed for three presidents of the United States.
Yo-Yo Ma was born in Paris. His parents were Chinese. His mother, Marina Lu, was a singer, and his father, Hiao-Tsiun Ma, was a professor of music. His family moved to New York when he was four years old. 
Ma began studying violin when he was very small. He also played the viola for a short while, then, at the age of four, he started the cello. He was a child prodigy and began performing to audiences at the age of five. When he was seven he performed to President John F. Kennedy . At the age of eight he appeared on American television in a concert conducted by Leonard Bernstein. By the time he was fifteen, Ma had graduated from Trinity School in New York and appeared as a soloist with the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra playing Tchaikovsky’s 'Variations on a Rococo Theme".
Ma studied at the Juilliard School of Music. His teacher was Leonard Rose. He went to Columbia University and then Harvard University. At one time he had doubts about whether he should continue his studies, but in the 1970s he was inspired by the recordings of Pablo Casals.
By this time he had played with several of the world's great orchestras. His recordings and performances of the "Johann Sebastian Bach: Cello Suites" recorded in 1983 and again in 1994-1997 have been particularly praised. He has also played lots of chamber music, often with the pianist Emanuel Ax whom he had met at the Julliard School of Music.

Pat Paulsen

Patrick Layton "Pat" Paulsen (July 6, 1927 – April 24, 1997) was an American comedian and actor. His longest-running role was as a frequent "candidate" for President of the United States.
Paulsen was born in South Bend, Washington. Paulsen had served in the United States Marines during World War II. After the war, he went to college, and worked a variety of jobs (as a salesman, an , a truck driver, and others) before starting a comedy with his brother. After the troupe broke up, Paulsen started performing on his own. He played at many of the same as the Smothers Brothers, before they became famous.
After the Smothers Brothers began a television variety show ("The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour") in 1967, they invited Paulsen to join their regular cast. He wrote for the show, and also appeared on camera in different roles. He began a series of mock editorials, that became very popular, by both poking fun at extremist opinions, and giving people reasons to think and talk about important issues (the First Amendment, gun control, drugs, and other matters). Hundreds of viewers wrote to CBS, who broadcast the "Comedy Hour", to ask for copies of the editorials.
During 1968 (an election year in the United States), Paulsen began a pretend "campaign" for President, and used the campaign to show the humor and irony in American politics. He did many of the things a real candidate would do, making public appearances, giving speeches, granting media interviews, and making his "stand on the issues" well known. When Election Day came, people in many places around the United States really did vote for Paulsen, as a candidate, because they were not satisfied with what the real candidates (Republican Richard M. Nixon, Democrat Hubert Humphrey, Alabama governor George Wallace, and others) promised to do as President.
After "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour" ended in 1969, Paulsen continued to work as a comedian and actor. Instead of just making people laugh, he often drew their attention to problems in American society, such as pollution, prejudice, and poor government. During the 1970s, he bought the Cherry County Playhouse, a theater in Traverse City, Michigan that showed .
Paulsen sometimes reunited with the Smothers Brothers, and usually staged another pretend campaign every election year. In 1992 he chose singer Tiny Tim as his , to become his Vice President. Paulsen died on April 24, 1997 from pneumonia from complications of brain and colon cancer, during medical treatment in Tajuana, Mexico, he was 69 years old. He is survived by his wife Noma Paulsen.

Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In

Laugh-In was an American television series, which ran on NBC from 1968 until 1974. Its hosts were comedians Dan Rowan and Dick Martin. The show's name came from a trend of naming public events with an "-In", such as the Human Be-In of 1967.
Begun as a one-time television , the first "Laugh-In" was so popular that it became a regular show in 1968. Hosts Rowan and Martin dressed in tuxedos, and played to the other performers on the show. Radio host Gary Owens played the show's . Producers George Schlatter and Ed Friendly worked behind the scenes, and did not appear on camera.
"Laugh-In" featured " humor", with most of its comedy based on current events. The show mocked contemporary trends and fashions, and imitated popular styles of the time. Regular features were "the Party", where performers told about current issues in a party setting, ""Laugh-In" Looks at the News", a mock news broadcast, and the "Joke Wall", where the cast ran from door to door in a specially-built wall, and told old jokes. The show also used , including "Sock it to me!", "You bet your bippy!" and "Look that up in your !"
The show featured a large cast of performers, including many who were new to television. These included Goldie Hawn, Arte Johnson, Lily Tomlin, Henry Gibson, Ruth Buzzi, Dave Madden, Joanne Worley, Alan Sues, Judy Carne and others. Several of the performers went on to longtime comedy and acting careers. British actor Jeremy Lloyd and "Hogan's Heroes" cast members Richard Dawson and Larry Hovis also appeared on the show for a time.
Guests on "Laugh-In" included Tiny Tim, The Monkees, Ringo Starr, and other famous singers and actors. Some were veterans of , while others were newly famous, or became famous partly through appearing on the show. Dewey "Pigmeat" Markham, an African-American comedian not known to white audiences, was first imitated on the show by Sammy Davis, Jr., then appeared himself, becoming a surprise hit with the same Judge routine he had played for years on the "chitlin' circuit". ("Here come the Judge!" became another show catchphrase.) Richard M. Nixon appeared in a short segment on the show, when he was campaigning for President of the United States, and some people believed this helped him get elected.
The series became less popular as time went on, and ended in 1974, with the show's producers explaining that they had "run out of things to parody" (make fun of). A reunion special in 1979 led to a short revival of the show as a "summer replacement" series, featuring guests like Robin Williams.

2005 Azores subtropical storm

The 2005 Azores subtropical storm was a type of tropical cyclone in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm was not named by the National Hurricane Center, because it was not found until after the season ended. The storm formed in the Atlantic Ocean, and it became a "subtropical cyclone" on October 4. The storm did not last a long time. It passed over the Azores, and it stopped being a subtropical cyclone on October 5. What was left of the storm went on to become Hurricane Vince. After the hurricane season ended, the National Hurricane Center checked to make sure they did not miss any storms during the year. Some forecasters found this storm, which was not noticed while it was active. 
The system formed from a weather system to the west of the Canary Islands on September 28. The weather system gained strength over the next few days. On October 3, it became a type of low pressure system. Thunderstorms around the storm began to become more active, and it then became a type of cyclone that is called a "subtropical depression".
At about the same time, the depression turned towards the northeast and gained strength. It became a subtropical "storm", which is stronger than a subtropical "depression". The storm gained a bit more strength later that day. It then moved across the Azores, and began to weaken. The storm weakened slightly as it moved to the north-northeast. The storm died out on October 5. What was left of the storm later became Subtropical Storm Vince.
High winds were reported in parts of the Azores because of the storm. The strongest winds were on Santa Maria Island, where there was a gust of 59 mph (94 km/h). Ponta Delgada also saw 52 mph (85 km/h) wind gusts. There was no damage and there were no deaths. The storm was not said to be a subtropical storm until the National Hurricane Center found it on April 10, 2006. Every year, the National Hurricane Center checks to make sure they did not miss any storms during the past tropical storm season. If the storm was found when it was active, it would have been named "Tammy".

The Sobig worm is a large emailing worm that sent itself to any email addresses with file extensions like .dbx, .eml, .hlp, .htm, .html, .mht, .wab, and .txt. The worm often used an email that includes "Re:" to seem as if people were being replied to from someone. The user would then open the email and click on the attachment, running the worm and downloading it on to their computer.
The worm was first found on August 18, 2003. After the infection had started, the worm tried to connect to the Internet to get to updates from 20 different internet servers on August 20. However, security officials were able to cut off and shut down the servers. The worm had a shut off date set for September 10, 2003.
At the height of the infection, the Sobig worm made up one in seventeen emails sent over the internet. The Sobig worm created over 1 million copies of itself for the rest of 2003.

The band was made in 1995, when Minowa got other musicians together to help out with some of his solo music, or music made by himself. The band's early music was liked by many record labels. The labels made many offers to sell Cloud Cult's music, but the band decided to self-publish instead, which means that they make their albums themselves without the help of a company. As the band became more popular and started playing live more often, Connie Minowa and Scott West started painting onstage during shows. .
In 1997, Craig Minowa started Earthology Records on his organic farm. The new record company now sells the bands' music. 
The band's newest album, "Feel Good Ghosts (Tea-Partying Through Tornadoes)" was released on April 8, 2008. The album is their most popular album yet. Also in 2008, a documentary about the band was made.
After the album was released, Craig Minowa said that it might be the last Cloud Cult album ever. The band is currently taking a break, so the members can focus on their families. 
In October of 2008, the band had a song in an animated Esurance commercial. The band is shown playing their instruments while floating on clouds. After making the commercial, the band put a few songs on Esurance's website. The songs are available to freely download.

The Aristocats

The Aristocats is a 1970 American animated movie. It was produced by Walt Disney Productions. It is the 20th movie in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. The movie is based on a story by Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe. It is about a family of cats who are kidnapped by their owner's butler. It was originally released to theaters by Buena Vista Distribution on December 11, 1970, with a regular release on December 24, 1970. The title is a pun on the word "aristocrats".
The movie's basic idea is an animated romantic musical comedy about talking cats in France. This idea had previously been used in the UPA animated feature "Gay Purr-ee".
Disney planned to release a sequel, "The Aristocats II" in 2007. Production on that was canceled in early 2006.
The was the last movie to be approved by Walt Disney himself. Disney died before the movie was released.
The movie takes place in Paris in 1910. A mother cat named Duchess and her three kittens, Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse, are going to receive a fortune when their owner dies. But Edgar, their butler, does not like this and plans to send the cats away.
He places sleeping tablets in their dinner. At night, he plans on dropping them off in the countryside. Two hound dogs, Napoleon and Lafayette, attack him, and the cats are now stranded.
In the morning, they meet an alley cat named Abraham de Lacy Giuseppe Casey Thomas O'Malley (called just Thomas O'Malley). He helps them on their way back home. He even lets them stay at his "pad" (the place where he and his "gang", or friends, stay).
They finally get back home, but Edgar recatches them in a sack and plans to send them to Timbuktu, Africa. O'Malley, Scat Cat and his gang, Roquefort and Frou-Frou all fight Edgar, while Roquefort rescues Duchess and kittens. In the end, Edgar is kicked into the trunk, locked inside, and sent to Timbuktu himself. Madame Adelaide's will is rewritten to not include Edgar and include O'Malley, and she starts a charity foundation which gives a home to all the cats in Paris.
This movie was the last one to be approved by Walt himself. It was the first one produced after his death. The movie took four years to produce. Its budget was 4,000,000. Five of Disney's legendary "Nine Old Men" worked on it, including the Disney crew that had been working 25 years on average.
"The Aristocats" was re-released to theaters on December 19, 1981 and April 10, 1987. It was released on VHS in the Masterpiece Collection series on April 24, 1996 and DVD on April 4, 2000 in the Gold Classic Collection line.

E number

E numbers are number codes for food additives. They are usually found on food labels throughout the European Union. The numbering scheme follows that of the International Numbering System (INS) as determined by the Codex Alimentarius committee. Only a subset of the INS additives are approved for use in the European Union, the 'E' prefix which stands for Europe. In casual language in the UK and Ireland, the term "E-number" is used as a pejorative term for artificial food additives, and products may promote themselves as "free of E-numbers" even though some of the ingredients (e.g. bicarbonate of soda) do have such a code.
E numbers are also encountered on food labeling in other jurisdictions, including the GCC, Australia, New Zealand and Israel. They are increasingly (though still rarely) found on North American packaging, especially in Canada. The "E" prefix is omitted in Australia and New Zealand, and the term "E-Number" unknown.

George Wallace

George Corley Wallace (August 25, 1919 – September 13, 1998) was an American politician. He served as Governor of Alabama serving from 1963 to 1967. He ran for President of the United States two times.
Wallace was born in Cilio, Alabama. He began his long political career at the age of 33 after running for county judge.
When Wallace was running for President, he was shot and paralyzed for the rest of his life. His is known for having different views on segregation. He was a Democrat.
Wallace died at the age of 79 from a spinal infection after 26 years of being in a wheelchair.
Wallace was born George Corely Wallace on August 25, 1919 in Clio, Alabama. He studied at University of Alabama. He grew up in a lower middle class family. As a young man, he was an amateur boxer, where he fought as a bantamweight.
Wallace was a very short man for his entire life, and as an adult was about 5'2" (1.57m)
He served four terms as governor of Alabama, and also ran for President of the United States several times, during the 1960s and 1970s. Wallace was a longtime supporter of segregation; a policy that did not allow African-Americans to attend the same schools, or go to many of the same public places, as white people. In 1963 he stood in a schoolhouse door to prevent black students from attending the school (which would have integrated the school). In a speech, he said he would support "segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever". He was a controversial figure. Some people saw him as a man who spoke up for the poor and was an outspoken populist. Others viewed him as a terrible person, a white supremacist who encouraged violence.
In time, he changed his views, and said that he was sorry to African-Americans, and other people hurt by segregation. He promoted black equality in his last term as Governor. Despite this, he remains an icon of racism today and many people think of him as one of the most evil figures in American history.
During the 1972 presidential campaign, Wallace was shot five times by a would-be assassin, Arthur Bremer. He suffered permanent injury to his spine. He could no longer walk, and spent the rest of his life using a wheelchair.
After his last term as governor, he began speaking in public places (including churches), to promote tolerance and friendship between people of different races.
Wallace was married to Laurleen Wallace until her death. Then he was married to Corelia Wallace until they divorced. Then he was married to Lisa Taylor until they divored. He had four children.
The Lynyrd Skynyrd song "Sweet Home Alabama" has the line "In Birmingham they love the Governor / Boo Boo Boo / Now we all did what we could do / if watergate does not bother me / does your conscience bother you now tell me true." Even though Wallace is not mentioned by name, the line clearly refers to him, and members of the band have confirmed this and have said they disliked Wallace.
Gary Sinise played him in the film "George Wallace".
A tunnel on Interstate 10 in Alabama has been named the George Wallace Memorial Tunnel.
Wallace died on September 13, 1998 in Montgomery, Alabama from a spinal infection, aged 79. He was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Montgomery.

Homo ergaster

Homo ergaster, also called "African "Homo erectus"", is an extinct chronospecies of "Homo" which lived in eastern and southern Africa during the early Pleistocene, between 1.8 million and 1.3 million years ago.
There is still disagreement on the subject of the classification and ancestry of "H. ergaster". However, it is now widely accepted as the direct ancestor of Asian "Homo erectus", "Homo neanderthalensis", "Homo heidelbergensis", and hence "Homo sapiens".
It is one of the earliest members of the genus "Homo", possibly ancestral to, or sharing a common ancestor with, "Homo erectus". Some paleoanthropologists consider "H. ergaster" is just the African variety of "H. erectus". There are Asian fossils of "H. erectus", which was the first human species to spread from Africa. 
The name "ergaster" means "workman", in reference to the Acheulean hand axe industry developed by the species. The species' period in eastern and southern Africa coincided with the first part of the Pleistocene, the cooling of the global climate and the start of the ice ages. These events would have shrunk the rainforests in Africa, and expanded the savannahs and open forests to which "ergaster" was well suited.

A lolcat is a picture of a cat with a funny caption. The caption is usually in bad English that makes fun of Internet slang. "Lolcat" is a mix of the words lol and cat. Lol is internet slang for "laughing out loud." A different word for lolcat is "cat macro" because it is a type of image macro. The first time the media talked about lolcats was when Time Magazine covered them in an article. The article said that lolcats and other things like them are becoming rare. It also said that they have a "distinct...Usenet feel to [them]." 
Lolcats are pictures of cats doing something out of the ordinary quoted words in big, sans serif letters (letters without feet). Sometimes the picture is changed with a computer to make it funnier.

Tropical Storm Cristobal (2002)

Tropical Storm Cristobal was a cyclone that formed in August of 2002. It stayed away from land for most of its life. However, when it died out, what was left of the storm caused rain and wind on Bermuda. It also caused stormy seas that caused three people to drown near Long Island. No severe damage happened.
A cyclone formed on August 5. At that time, it was located about 175 miles (280 km/h) to the east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. The storm then moved towards the southeast. On August 6, the rain and clouds around the storm began to get weaker. However, the storm gained enough strength to be named Tropical Storm Cristobal on August 6.
The tropical storm was still moving towards the southeast when it became Cristobal. On August 7, it turned to the east. Cristobal then reached its highest strength. It began to weaken after that. Early on August 9, Tropical Storm Cristobal merged with another weather system, when it was located about 350 miles (560 km) to the southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. What was left of the storm passed near Newfoundland on August 10. It fully died near Greenland on August 14.
Cristobal stayed mostly away from land while it was a tropical cyclone. However, what was left of it after it died out brought rain and wind to Bermuda. A wind gust of 45 mph (72 km/h) happened at the Bermuda International Airport. 2.78 inches (71 mm) of rain fell in 24 hours. This rain was partly because of Cristobal. Cristobal also caused rip currents and 4 foot (1.2 m) waves along the south shore of Long Island, New York. Three people drowned in the rip currents. Two ships in the ocean reported high winds because of the storm.

Captain Moonlite

Andrew George Scott (January 8, 1845 — January 20, 1880) was a famous Australian bushranger, known as Captain Moonlite, sometimes spelt "Moonlight". He lived in Victoria and was different from other bushrangers. There are a lot of stories and legends told about Captain Moonlight.
Scott was born in Rathfriland, County Down, Ireland, in 1842. His father was an Anglican clergyman. Scott had a good education, good manners, and had read the Bible. He left Ireland and went to London. After hearing about the gold rushes in Australia he made his way to Victoria. He went to New Zealand and took part in the Maori Wars in 1861. He was speared in the leg, which left him with a limp. At the end of the war, he went back to Melbourne and began to train as a clergyman in the Church of England.
He began work with the church in the Bacchus Marsh area. He lived at the small town of Mount Egerton. From there he went travelled around, visiting people, and doing church work.
At 1.00 am, Andrew came to the bank with his face covered, and armed with a gun, went into the house of the Mount Egerton bank manager, Mr. Brunn. The robber forced Brunn to walk down to the school and write a note, which said, “Captain Moonlite has stuck me up and robbed the bank.” They went back to the bank where Moonlight tied Brunn up before taking all the money. In the morning, the teacher, Mr. Simpson, found the note. He ran to the bank and untied Brunn. Brunn told the police that the man was the preacher, Andrew Scott. Scott said it was a lie, and told the police it was a plan by Brunn and Simpson to steal money from the bank. Everyone believed the preacher, and the police arrested Brunn and Simpson for robbing the bank.
Scott left Mount Egerton and told people he was going to go to the South Pacific. He was the main witness in the bank robbery. When he left, the police had to drop the charges against Brunn and Simpson. He bought a boat, the "Swallow", and sailed out of Sydney with a group of rich young men. He just passed through the Sydney Heads when a police steam launch caught up with him and made him go back. He had paid for the boat with a bad cheque. He was sent to gaol (jail) for 18 months.
As soon as he was let out of gaol in Sydney, he was arrested for the Mount Egerton robbery. The police put him in the new Ballarat Gaol to wait for his trial. He was able to make a hole into the next cell. With help from another prisoner, Dermoodie, they overpowered the guard and locked him in the cell. They let all the other prisoners out of their cells. They stood on each other's backs and shoulders to get to the top of the gaol wall. Using a rope made from blankets tied together, the prisoners climbed the wall and escaped. Within one week, the police got back all the prisoners. The court gave Scott ten years in gaol for the bank robbery and one year for escaping from Ballarat. He was locked up in Pentridge Gaol. Scott behaved in gaol. After he was let out of gaol, he spoke at meetings about prison reform.
On November 18, 1879, a group of bushrangers led by Captain Moonlight, held up the Wantabadgery station (farm), east of Wagga Wagga. They stayed there for three days and held up all the people travelling along the road. They held about 30 people prisoner. One person was able to escape and tell the police. Two groups of police from Wagga Wagga and Gundagai went to the farm. After a lot of shooting, the bushrangers left and the police chased them through the bush. A bushranger, Gus Wernicke, aged 15, was shot and died in great pain. A policeman, Constable Bowen was badly hurt, and died a few days later. Captain Moonlight gave himself up to the police. The police captured the rest of the gang a few days later.
The police charged the bushrangers with the murder of Bowen. In court at Darlinghurst, Sydney, Scott tried to take the blame for the crime. He wanted the lives of his friends saved. Captain Moonlight, and gang member, Rogan, were hanged on January 20, 1880. In a letter from prison, Scott asked to buried next to his friend, James Nesbitt. In 1995 he was reburied at Gundagai next to gang members Gus Wernicke and James Nesbitt. A death mask was made of Scott by Walter McGill. This mask is now in the Justice and Police Museum, New South Wales.
The State Library of Victoria has a drawing of Scott made in November, 1879, in its collection. This can be seen on line. Artist Patrick William Marony painted a picture in 1894 of the gang (Scott, Bennett, Rogan, Nesbit and Williams), which he called "The Moonliters". It is kept in the National Library of Australia and can be seen online.

Barrel organ

A barrel organ plays music by using turning a barrel, with notes decided by an arrangement of pins. It is very similar to a simple music box where the pins pluck a metal harp. With a barrel organ, the pins in the barrel lift "keys" that open valves that let air from the bellows to play the pipes. 
The barrel organ is sometimes wrongly called a hurdy gurdy, which is a string instrument. Barrel organs come in many different sizes from hand carried ones to large sizes carried on a wagon or trailer. Usually each barrel had a number of tunes on it, and the tune could be changed to different selection by lifting an indexing pin and sliding the barrel to the next index position. Even a small hand carried organ could play six or eight tunes. Stationary barrel organs, built into large houses or churches, were larger pipe organs, and could play longer, and more serious music. Some had different barrels or revolving barrel changers, which meant they did not need an organist to play them, and had a larger selection of music. Organs built in a church, allowed people to sing, accompanied by organ. Some of the only organ music composed by Mozart, was supposedly written for a barrel organ built into a clock.

Jack Donahue

Jack Donahue (1804 — 1 September, 1830), sometimes called John Donohue, was a famous Australian bushranger. With the exception of Ned Kelly, there have been more songs, poems and stories about him than any other bushranger. He quickly became a folk hero. Governor Ralph Darling told hotel owners they would have their hotels closed if they allowed people to sing songs about Donahue.
Jack Donahue was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1804. He was in trouble with the police for his political activities to gain independence for Ireland. In 1824, he was found guilty of “intent to commit a felony”. This means he was going to do something wrong, but he had not done it yet. He was sent to Sydney on the convict ship "Ann and Amelia", which arrived on 2 January, 1825. He was sent to work for a Mr. Pagan at Parramatta. He was soon in trouble and put to work on a road gang. Major West, at Quaker’s Hill, employed Donahue to look after his pigs.
With two other men, George Kilroy and Bill Smith, he held up some carts on the Richmond Road. The police soon caught them and the court sentenced them to death. As he was being taken back to gaol (jail) in Sydney he escaped. The government offered a reward of £20 for his capture.
In August 1828, Donahue and a gang of eight robbed houses south of Bathurst. A police group nearly captured Donahue near Goulburn. They shot at the gang, and killed several gang members. Donahue escaped and was not seen for several months.
He next appeared in the Nepean River valley around the towns of Liverpool, Penrith, Windsor, Parramatta and Liberty Plains. They robbed the Reverend Samuel Marsden near Windsor. Donahue was working with a man known as “Darky” Underwood, and an escaped convict Jack Walmsley. The government increased the reward to £50.
In April 1830, Governor Ralph Darling made a special law to try to stop bushranging. The police could arrest anyone, enter and search houses without having to have a warrant. There were many stories, some people said Donahue and Underwood had gone to New Zealand, others said they had been killed by the aborigines. On 22 May, 1830, Donahues' gang held up the famous explorer, Charles Sturt. Donahue recognized Sturt and told the others to let him go.
On 1 September, 1830, a group of police and soldiers searching for Donahue found him near a creek at Bringelly. Donahue shouted at them to try to capture him. Private John Muckleston fired his rifle and pistol, hitting Donahue in the neck and forehead. He died soon afterward. His body was taken to Sydney. The surveyor and explorer, Sir Thomas Mitchell, drew a picture of Donahue. This is the only known picture of him.
Walmlsey was shot and killed soon after. Gang member Bill Webber was caught and hanged. Darky Underwood was shot and killed in 1832.
There are many songs and poems about the life of Jack Donahue. These include:

Frederick Ward (bushranger)

Frederick Ward, also known as “"Captain Thunderbolt"”, was an Australian bushranger. He lived in northern New South Wales. Some people thought he was like Robin Hood, who robbed from the rich to help the poor.
Ward was born Windsor, New South Wales in 1835. His father, Michael Ward, had been sent to Australia as a convict in 1815. Fred was one of eleven children. He was arrested in 1856 for selling 50 stolen horses, and sent to prison on Cockatoo Island for ten years. After four years he was given a ticket of leave which meant he was able to leave the gaol as long as he reported to the police every three months.
Ward went to the Mudgee area to work. There he met a girl named Mary Ann Bugg who had a convict father and aboriginal mother. Mary Ann fell pregnant soon afterwards. Ward took her back to her father's farm near Dungog and did not report to the Mudgee police on time. His ticket of leave was cancelled. When he reached the Mudgee police station, he was also arrested for stealing the horse he was riding. He was sent back to Cockatoo Island to finish his six years in gaol plus another three for the stolen horse. 
On 11 September 1863, he and Fred Britten escaped from gaol. They swam from Cockatoo Island and headed north to the New England district in north-east New South Wales. The government put up a reward of £25 for Ward’s capture. Late in October 1863, they robbed a woman at Gostwyck Hut, near Armidale, and stole a shotgun and some bacon. A few days later they were seen by the police near Thunderbolt's Rock. In the gunfight that followed Ward was shot in the back of the left knee. The two bushrangers split up soon afterwards. 
In December 1863, Ward tried to take money from the toll keeper on the road between Maitland and Rutherford. There were only a few shillings in the cash box. Ward took the money but later gave it back. As he left, he told the toll keeper that his name was "Captain Thunderbolt". He then went into the Spread Eagle Inn (hotel) and asked for food. When he asked for his bill, the owner, Mrs. Byrne, told him that there was no charge. He replied that since she was so nice, he was not going to rob her. The police began to search for him but he managed to escape. 
In 1864, Ward and Mary Ann lived quietly in the north-western plains near Bourke. Early in 1865 he joined up with three other men and formed his first gang. His three companions were McIntosh, Thomas Hogan (also known as The Bull), and a youth called John Thompson. They robbed travellers and stations near Collarenebri. A group of police from Bourke followed their tracks and found their camp in the bush. The gang escaped but Mary Ann and her two children were captured by the police. They started to take her to Bourke but she pretended she was having a baby and they left her at a nearby station. Ward went to the station and rescued his family, and took gunpowder and food. Ward and his first gang broke up after young Thompson was shot and nearly killed in April 1865 at Millie near Moree. Mary Ann was arrested again in 1866 and also in 1867 but she was soon released from prison because of support from the community. 
Late in 1865, Ward formed his second bushranging gang with Patrick Kelly and Jemmy the Whisperer. They robbed as far south as 
Quirindi, Currabubula and Carroll. At Carroll they had another shoot-out with the police in December 1865 where a trooper was shot in the arm. The gang split up early in January 1866. 
Ward had another quiet year in 1866. Early in 1867 he took on another young accomplice, Thomas Mason. They carried out robberies from near Scone as far north as the Queensland border. Mason was captured by the police in September 1867. Later that year, Ward and Mary Ann separated. Mary Ann lived for the rest of her life at Mudgee where she died in 1905.
In 1868 Ward took on another young accomplice, William Monckton, and they committed many robberies in northern New South Wales. They separated in December 1868 and soon afterwards Monckton was captured by the police. Ward did not have any other accomplices. Some claim that Thunderbolt was involved in about 80 robberies and stole about £20,000, but his takings were much smaller than that. 
On 25 May 1870 the police at Uralla were told that Thunderbolt was robbing travellers at Blanch's Royal Oak Inn, near Thunderbolt's Rock Constable Alexander Binney Walker chased after Ward on horseback for six or seven miles until they reached Kentucky Creek, south-west of Uralla. Ward jumped off his horse and began swimming across the creek. Constable Walker shot Thunderbolt’s horse, then he shot and killed Ward himself. Ward was later buried at Uralla. 
While there have been stories that it was Ward's brother William who was killed, these stories are easily disproven.
Thunderbolt's Rock and Blanch's Royal Oak Inn were added to New South Wales State Heritage List in July 2012. This listing will protect the site which are now important places for tourists who come to the area. The site of his death at Kentucky Creek, and his grave, have also been added to the Heritage List.

Polish literature

Almost no Polish literature remains before Christianisation in the 10th century. Polish literature was written in the Latin language during the Middle Ages (there are only several Polish language texts from that times).
The Polish language was accepted as equal to Latin after the Renaissance for literature.
Jan Kochanowski was a leading poet of European Renaissance literature in the 16th century.
Polish writers were inspired by Western European literature but they had their own ideas and trends too. Those trends were coming to Poland because of noble people's travells and political contacts but they were becoming popular some time later then in other countries.
Polish Baroque literature had to trends: elitary one (Jan Andrzej Morsztyn, Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski, Daniel Naborowski) and the other one, created by usual nobles (Jan Chryzostom Pasek).
In times of Enlightenment Polish literature was influenced by France. Poland-Lithuania was very weak country and needed political changes. Literature was mainly about society and state, not about love or religion.
In 19th century Poland was not independent. From 1822 to 1863 there was Romanticism in Polish literature. Romantic poets include Adam Mickiewicz who wrote "Pan Tadeusz" epic in 1834, Juliusz Słowacki and Zygmunt Krasiński.
After failed anti-Russian uprising in 1863 Romanticism ended in Poland.
Several Polish novelists have won the Nobel prize. Henryk Sienkiewicz won in 1905. He wrote dramatized versions of famous events in Polish history. Władysław Reymont won a Nobel prize in 1924. He wrote the novel Chłopi.
Stanisław Lem is famous science fiction author in the modern era. His "Solaris" novel was made twice into a feature film.

Motion of Confidence

A Motion of Confidence is a motion of support proposed by a government in a parliament or other assembly of elected representatives to give members of parliament (or other such assembly) a chance to register their confidence in a government. The motion is passed or rejected by means of a parliamentary vote (a Vote of Confidence). Governments often propose a Motion of Confidence to replace a Motion of No Confidence proposed by the opposition.
Defeat of a Motion of Confidence in a parliamentary democracy generally requires one of two actions: the resignation of the government, or a request for a parliamentary dissolution and the calling of a General Election.
In Italy they are governed by the Constitution only the motion of confidence and that of not-confidence, respectively to start and to end the life of a government; the question of confidence, by which the government asks a Chamber to approve without change its texts, is the result of a tradition of the late nineteenth century and is increasingly used to accelerate the legislative process, but does not apply to rules for amending Constitution.

Coca

Coca is a plant in the family Erythroxylaceae, native to north-western South America. The plant plays a significant role in traditional Andean culture. Coca leaves contain cocaine alkaloids, a basis for the drug cocaine, which is a powerful stimulant. Today the plant has many uses, including traditional use by Andean cultures to flavoring Coca-Cola products to use as an anesthetic.
Coca has been cultivated by Andean cultures for thousands of years. Traditionally people would chew the leaf or soak it in hot water to make tea in order to experience the various benefits the leaf provides. Coca was introduced to Europe in the 16th century. After its stimulating effects were described by a European doctor in the 19th century, people began to refine the leaves to get cocaine. As people began to learn more about cocaine it began to be banned in many countries. In 1961 the United Nations classified the coca leaf as a narcotic even though studies had shown the leaf itself was non-addictive. This has led the United States to pressure coca-growing countries such as Peru and Bolivia to stop growing coca entirely. These countries have responded by fighting the 1961 decision, trying to remove the coca plant from the list.

The Great Sphinx

The Great Sphinx is at Giza near Cairo in Egypt. It sits in a depression to the south of the pyramid of the Pharaoh Khafre (Chephren) at the west bank of the Nile River. The Sphinx is a stone sculpture of a creature with a human head and a lion's body. The greatest monumental sculpture in the ancient world, its body is 200 feet (60m)long and 65 feet (20m) tall. Its face is 13 feet (4m) wide.
An accumulating body of evidence, both archaeological and geological, shows the Sphinx is far older than the 4th Dynasty (2575-2467 BCE) and was restored by Khafre during his reign. The name 'Sphinx' means 'strangler' but the purpose of the Sphinx is not known. Some archaeologists assume that it was a memorial to a Pharaoh or that it functioned as some sort of talisman or guardian god. Other scholars believe the Sphinx as an astronomical observation device that marked the position of the rising sun on the day of the spring equinox in the time of Leo the Lion.
The statue is eroding today because of wind and humidity and the smog from Cairo. Attempts to restore it have often caused more harm than good. Present attempts at restoration are under the control of the Supreme Council of Antiquities' archaeologists. They are working to drain away underground water.

It was abolished in 1801 when it joined the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. It is now two states.

Xylophone

A xylophone is a musical instrument that is part of the percussion family. It belongs to the group which is often called "pitched percussion" or tuned percussion because it can play different pitches and is a different way of expressing the sound that it creats. (notes). Xylophones have bars which are made of wood. People play the xylophone by hitting the bars with a mallet (a kind of drum stick). Each piece of wood is a different length, so they play different notes when they are hit. The bars are arranged like the keys of a piano. Underneath the bars there are long tubes, called resonators, which make the sound last longer.
The modern orchestral xylophone developed from xylophones found in Africa and Asia. It came as a folk instrument to countries in Central Europe. It was first used in an orchestra by Humperdinck in his opera "Hansel and Gretel". It was also used by Saint-Saëns in his "Danse macabre" where it is supposed to sound like a skeleton, and in his "Carnival of the Animals" where it is supposed to sound like fossils. 
The xylophone is usually played so that the music sounds an octave higher than written. Because the sound is always very short the xylophone is often used for short solo tunes which are fast and dry.
The marimba is a kind of xylophone which has a softer sound and more bars, especially low notes. It is not often used in older orchestra music. 
Xylophones and marimbas are usually played with two mallets, but it is possible for good players to play with four (two in each hand).

Bibimbap

Bibimbap is one of the most famous Korean traditional foods. The word "bibimbap" means stirred or mixed rice. It is served as a bowl of rice with more ingredients on it. These ingredients can include some vegetables (spinach, herbs, potherb, and gosari). Beef or seafood can be added too.
There are some theories or stories about the origin of Bibimbap. It was the first written about in a cook book in the late 1800s. The first theory is the "palace food theory". It says that bibimbap was served as a light meal whenever the king wanted something to eat.
The second theory is the "meal for peasants during the farming season". As it was too difficult for peasants to have regular meals during the farming season, they would use a single bowl, where rice was combined with vegetables.
The third theory is the "Donghak uprising theory". When Donghak uprising broke out in the Jeolla provinces in 1894, the Donghak peasants were forced to mix their rice with side dishes because they didn't have enough plates or bowls.
Because Bibimbap has many ingredients, it contains a lot of nutrition. Also, its color and appearance, can be very different. It is easy to prepare and clean up because it is all packed in one bowl.

Class struggle

Class struggle, or class warfare or class conflict, is tension or antagonism in society. It is said to exist because different groups of people have different interests.
Looking at society this way is a feature of Marxism and socialism. Social sciences group people with similar social features into classes. Most of these features are economic.
According to Marxism, there are two main classes of people: The bouregoisie controls the capital and means of production, and the proletariat provide the labour. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels say that for most of history, there has been a struggle between those two classes. This struggle is known as class struggle. After "The Communist Manifesto" and "Das Kapital", this concept became well known.
Class struggle happens when the rich business owners (called bourgeoisie) pay everyday workers (called proletariat), to make things for them to sell. The workers have no say in their pay or what things they make, since they can not live without a job or money.
Karl Marx was mad that the workers were forced to work without any say in the business. He believed that since the workers make the things, they should say where they go and for how much, instead of the rich owners. They had to work hard to earn a living, while making the rich richer just doing simple office work.
Since they had to earn money to buy food, and jobs were the only things that give money, they had no choice but to work for the rich who made the business. The rich became richer while the worker hauled and lifted and did all of that hard manual stuff no one really likes to do.
Karl Marx thought that their labor limited their freedom. He wanted the workers to unite and take over the business, so that they could all be prosperous. He thought that the common man deserved to run the business, and that the rich were not better than the commoner.
When money was created, everyone got their identical share regardless of how much or little they worked. Each person received equal pay, which Karl Marx saw as fair and just.
Class struggle appeared in some forms. First, there is an economic form. The proletariat struggle with the bourgeoisie through their laborer's organization in this form. Second, there is a political form. In this form, the proletariat has their party and, through democracy, they try to change the system. And the last, there is an ideological struggle. In this form, the proletariat try to adapt the old governing system to new social situations. There are other forms of struggle, too. These forms are not exclusive, but exist at the same time.
Class struggle appeared all throughout history. At first, people lived in small communist societies. Then, they took property from the Earth for themselves and started to use slaves. They then had feudalism, which meant one person owned an entire area of land and used soldiers and workers to help them make money, and only gave their workers land, but they had some freedom that slaves didn't. Finally, in Karl Marx's time, people in some countries were becoming workers and bosses during the industrial revolution. The bosses owned the machines that the workers used to make things, but they didn't help using the machines. Instead, they made money by buying the time and energy of the workers to make things. Marx believed that the workers weren't making the money they deserved because the boss would make money from the work they did without helping.
Marx believed that countries would overthrow capitalism and that workplaces would move toward socialism. This roughly means that the workers would control the workplaces. When this has happened everywhere, Marx thought the world will have achieved communism.
The Soviet Union overthrew feudalism. They never reached the point of capitalism, so their society was very corrupt. Many blame them for the bad name of communism. There are some workplaces and societies are run democratically by workers, such as the kibbutzim in Israel.
Social democrats and liberal conservatives do not see society as described by Marx. They see society as changing gradually, through the system of democratic voting. The European Union is composed almost entirely of countries governed by this kind of system, but it is not universal throughout the world. Very few countries have undergone the kind of revolution forecast by Marx. It is much more common for military leaders to seize power and enforce a dictatorship which is neither democratic nor revolutionary.

Grand Korean Waterway

The Grand Korean Waterway plan, officially known as the Pan Korea Grand Waterway(한반도대운하, 韓半島大運河), consists of 3 canals; the Seoul-Busan Canal (GyeongBu Canal,경부운하), the Honam Canal (호남운하), and the North Korea Canal (BukHan Canal, 북한운하).
The Seoul-Busan Canal would run between Seoul and Busan, which are two of South Korea's largest cities, connecting the Han River and Nakdong River. Honam Canal, which would run through ChungCheongBuk-do, ChungCheongNam-do, JeollaBuk-do, and JeollaNam-do, connects Geum River and YeongSan River. The North Korea Canal would connect SinUiJu-Pyongyang-GaeSeong, Wonsan-GaeSeong. 
The canal is a project of Lee Myung Bak, who is the present president of South Korea. It is hugely controversial. Many Koreans object to this plan. President Lee said that he would not carry out this plan if many people objected to this idea, but there was a person who works in the Korea Institute of Construction Technology(한국건설기술연구원) has confessed that government's 'Four-Major-River Arrangement Plan' is a canal project in reality.
The major canal in this plan is the GyeongBu Canal(Seoul-Busan Canal, 경부운하).
The GyeongBu Canal starts in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. It flows along the Han River, and encounter with mountains. And then 40 km-long tunnel begins, connecting the Han River with the Nakdong River.
Many Koreans are anxious about this plan. Critics of the plan say that this canal is not efficient at all. They say that mountains along the proposed route would make it difficult and expensive to construct. Currently, the major transportation method on the GyeongBu (Seoul-Busan) line is road transport, which takes 5 hours. However, ships following the GyeongBu Canal will take 25 hours to finish the trip. Critics believe this plan would just be a waste of money. In addition, it could be harmful to the environment and damage cultural treasures. On the other hand, supporters of this plan say that this canal will lessen congestion on the GyeongBu Expressway and GyeongBu Railroad line. Furthermore, sand from dredging the river bed could be sold for use in construction. They argue that this money could be used to fund the construction of the canals. However, critics argue that sand prices will be so cheap that little money will be earned from selling the sand. They say that it is only beneficial to the construction industry.

Tropical Storm Arthur (2008)

Tropical Storm Arthur was the first tropical storm to form in May since 1981. Arthur was a weak tropical storm that affected Central America. Arthur was the first tropical storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. Arthur formed from the remains of dissipating Tropical Storm Alma which crossed Central America from the Pacific Ocean. Arthur caused nine deaths in Belize and caused $78 million in damage.

Tropical Storm Fay (2008)

Tropical Storm Fay was the sixth tropical storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. Tropical Storm Fay caused flooding in Haiti, the next three storms would do that same thing (Gustav, Hanna, and Ike). Tropical Storm Fay made landfall in Florida four times, beating a record from Hurricane Gordon in 1994, which made landfall in Florida three times. Fay left $560 million in damage and killed 36 people.
Fay started as a tropical wave off of Africa on August 7. It did not become a tropical depression until August 15. Shortly later it became Tropical Storm Fay. Fay then crossed Dominican Republic and Haiti. 
Fay continued west and made two landfalls in Cuba. One in Cabo Cruz on August 17 and Cienfuegos on August 18, at both landfalls Fay had winds of 50 mph. 
Fay made its first landfall in Florida at Key West also on August 18 winds were at 60 mph. 
The next day Fay made landfall in Cape Romano, Florida while winds were at 65 mph. Fay moved over Florida and strangely strengthened while over Florida. Fay moved off of Florida near Melbourne. Fay moved north just off of Florida and made another landfall in Flagler Beach, Florida on August 21 while winds were at 65 mph. 
Fay moved into the Gulf of Mexico and then made her fourth and final landfall in Florida on August 23. Fay became extratropical on August 27 and also died on August 27. 
Even though Fay caused a lot of damage it was not retired, Fay is on the list of names in 2014.

Tropical Storm Marco (2008)

Tropical Storm Marco was the smallest tropical cyclone ever. It was the 13th named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. Marco started from a large storm over the northwestern Caribbean Sea during late September 2008. It later became a tropical depression. Marco reached its peak strength with winds of 65 miles per hour (100 km/h) on October 7. Marco hit land near Misantla, Veracruz. Because it was a very small storm, Marco caused little damage.

Baobab

Baobab is the common name of a genus of trees (Adansonia). There are nine species. Six species live in the drier parts of Madagascar, two in mainland Africa, and one in Australia. The baobab is the national tree of Madagascar.
Other common names include 'boab', 'boaboa', 'bottle tree', 'the tree of life', 'upside-down tree', and 'monkey bread tree'. The trees reach heights of 5 to 30 metres (16 to 98 ft) and trunk diameters of 7 to 11 metres (23 to 36 ft). Its trunk can hold up to 120,000 litres of water. For most of the year, the tree is leafless, and looks very much like it has its roots sticking up in the air.
Baobabs are one of the largest and most important trees in all of where they grow! You can use them for shelter, wood, and more.
The trees are long-lived, but just how long is disputed. The owners of Sunland Farm in Limpopo, South Africa have built a pub called "The Big Baobab Pub" inside the hollow trunk of the high tree. The tree is 47 m (155 ft) in circumference, and is said to have been carbon dated at over 6,000 years old.
The baobab tree is known as the tree of life, with good reason. It can provide shelter, clothing, food, and water for the animal and human inhabitants of the African savannah regions. The cork-like bark and huge stem are fire resistant and are used for making cloth and rope. The leaves are used as condiments and medicines. The fruit, called "monkey bread", is edible, and full of vitamin C. As of 2010 experts estimate the potential international market at a billion dollars($US) a year.
The fruit has a velvety shell and is about the size of a coconut, weighing about . It has a somewhat acidic flavour, described as 'somewhere between grapefruit, pear, and vanilla'.
The tree can store hundreds of litres of water, which is an adaptation to the harsh drought conditions of its environment. The tree may be tapped in dry periods. 
Mature trees are usually hollow, providing living space for many animals and humans. Trees are even used as bars, barns, wine and beer shops and more.

Hurricane Kenneth (2005)

Hurricane Kenneth was the strongest hurricane in the 2005 Pacific hurricane season. After the hurricane died out, what was left of Kenneth came near another weather system, and it caused rain on the Hawaiian Islands. Because of the heavy rain, there was flooding. At Nu‘uanu Pali on Oahu, the rain reached 10.25 inches (260.4 mm). The rain was so heavy that 4.11 inches (104 mm) fell in one hour. The rain reached 12 inches (305 mm) in other areas. This made Kenneth tied for the 9th rainiest tropical storm in Hawaii. One example of the flooding was 1 foot (300 mm) of water on Hawaii Route 61. This flooded a few houses. There was flooding on some rivers. 
Kenneth caused stormy seas along the coast. Waves were between 8 and 10 feet (2 and 3 metres) high. These high waves crashed along the east shores of these islands:
There was no bad damage, and no people were killed by Kenneth.

Réaumur scale

The Réaumur scale is a way of measuring temperature. The unit associated with the scale is called "Réaumur", named after the physicist René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur who created it in 1731. The unit is usually abbreviated "Ré", sometimes "r". The two base points of the scale are the melting point of ice and the boiling point of water, both at normal pressure. There are 80 degrees between those values, one degree Réaumur is the 80th part of that temperature difference. 
Réaumur used ethanol for his thermometers. Thermometers that use ethanol show the change of temperature better than those using mercury. This is because, when heated, ethanol expands faster than mercury. There is the problem though that the expansion of ethanol is different at different temperatures - it is non-linear. Ethanol has a very low boiling point, which makes thermometers based on it unusable for many applications. Soon, instrument-makers used other liquids, and then chose "80°Ré" as the boiling point of water. 
In 1772 Jean-André Deluc studied the several substances used in thermometers at the time. At the time, new theories of heat were being developed. 
Deluc's analysis came to the conclusion that mercury-based thermometers were the best for practical use: He made an experiment, as follows: Suppose there are two amounts of water, say one liter, are mixed. The two amounts have different temperatures. The temperature of both liquids are taken, before the mix, and the temperature of the mix is measured. The mix should have the temperature that is the mean of both temperatures. This relationship only held reliably, when mercury was used in thermometers. From the late 18th century, almost all thermometers used mercury, for this reason. Thermometers that use other substances than ethanol but have 80 scales between the boiling and the freezing points of water have nothing in common with Réaumur's thermometer, except for the name.

Gödel's incompleteness theorems

Gödel's incompleteness theorems is the name given to two theorems, proved by Kurt Gödel in 1931. They are theorems in mathematical logic.
In a formal system, there are axioms. All axioms are assumed to be true, at any rate for the purpose of the logic. A theorem then comes up with "other true statements from the axioms", using certain rules. A sequence of such statements is called a "proof" of a statement, because it shows that the statement is true, given the axioms. 
Ideally, it should be possible to construct all true statements in the formal system in that manner. A system that has this property is called "complete"; one that does not is called "incomplete". Another thing wanted of a theory is that there should be no contradictions. This means that it is not possible to prove that a statement is true and false at the same time. A system that does not include theories that allow this is called "consistent".
Gödel said that "every non-trivial formal system is either incomplete or inconsistent": 
Most people think this shows that Hilbert's program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all of mathematics is impossible. This would give a negative answer to Hilbert's second problem.

Cilia

A cilium (plural "cilia") is an organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Cilia are slender protuberances that project from the much larger cell body.
There are two types of cilia: 
In eukaryotes, cilia and flagella together make up a group of organelles known as undulipodia.
Eukaryotic cilia are structurally identical to eukaryotic flagella, although distinctions are sometimes made according to function and/or length.
Motile cilia are found on protist ciliates like "Paramecium". They are how "Paramecium" moves around. They are also found on the epithelial cells of many internal organs of metazoans, such as the digestive system and the trachea of the lungs.
Non-motile (or "primary") cilia usually occur one per cell; nearly all mammalian cells have a single non-motile "primary cilium". In addition, examples of specialized primary cilia can be found in human sensory organs such as the eye and the nose: 
Cilia are structurally almost identical with the much larger flagella. So much so that it has been proposed protists bearing either should be unified in the Phylum "Undulipodia". Previously, Margulis had proposed that the Ciliates alone should be placed in a Phylum "Ciliophora". Admittedly, the Protista is a collection of disparate single-celled forms, but while a more sophisticated taxonomy is in flux (changing), Protista is still a useful term.
Cilia and flagella are cell organelles, specialised units which carry out well-defined functions, like mitochondria and plastids. It is fairly certain now that all or most of these organelles have their origin in once-independent prokaryotes (bacteria or archaea), and that the eukaryote cell is a 'community of micro-organisms' working together in 'a marriage of convenience'.

30 Seconds to Mars

30 Seconds to Mars is an American alternative rock band from Los Angeles. This band was started in 1998 by the actor Jared Leto and his brother Shannon Leto. The current members of the band are Jared Leto (lead vocals), Tomo Miličević (lead guitar) and Shannon Leto (drummer).
Created in 1998 by the actor Jared Leto and his brother Shannon, 30 Seconds to Mars began as a small family project. Matt Wachter later joined the band as bassist and keyboard player. After working with two guitarists, Kevin Drake and Solon Bixler, the band auditioned Tomo Miličević to join the band.
According to an interview from Virgin Records, the band's name;"Actually comes
from a thesis that the band found online that was written by a former Harvard professor. And one of the subsections of the
thesis was titled "Thirty Seconds to Mars" and he goes on to talk about the exponential growth of technology that relates to humans and saying that we are quite literally thirty seconds to mars. What it means to us is, we thought it best described our music, in short."
Even if Jared Leto is a major Hollywood actor, he prefers not to use this information to "sell" the band and he refuses to play shows where they use his name to promote the band.
The self-titled album was released on the 27 August 2002 by Immortal Records and Virgin Records, produced by Bob Ezrin and Brian Virtue. The first single, "Capricorn (A Brand New Name)", peaks at number 31 an the Billboard's "Mainstream Rock Tracks". In the music video, the band members are in a desert where people are digging in mud pits. The band is playing in a ditch where others are watching them.
The second single is "Edge of the Earth". The music video is created by a series of live clips of 30 Seconds to Mars. It represents when Tomo Miličević joined in the band.
Their second album, "A Beautiful Lie", was released on the 30 August 2005 by Immortal Records and Virgin Records, produced by Josh Abraham. The first single, "Attack", brought 30 Seconds to Mars to world success. The video for the song was filmed in an abandoned hotel in Hollywood.
In January 2006 this album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for distribution of over one million albums. In March 2006 the band began their first tour from headliner, called "Forever Night, Never Day". In October 2006 the band began their "Welcome to the Universe Tour", sponsored by MTV2.
The second single from the album is "The Kill", and it follows the success of the precedent single. It spent 52 weeks on the Billboard's "Modern Rock Tracks". The music video is based on the American film "Shining". This single won the MTV2 Award at the MTV Video Music Awards, Best Single at the Kerrang! Awards, Best Live Action at the MTVu Woodie Awards, Video of the Year and Best Rock Video at the MTV Australian Music Awards and Best Video Inspired By Film at the Fuse Chainsaw Awards. This single was also at number 18 on MTV Italy's list of Top 100 Hits of 2007.
On the 1 March 2007, while on tour in El Paso, Texas, Jared Leto announced to the arena that was the last concert of 30 Seconds to Mars with Matt Wachter. He dedicated the final song of the show, "R-Evolve", to Matt. They are also played in various festivals as Roskilde, Rock am Ring, Pinkpop, Give It A Name and Download.
The third single from the album is "From Yesterday" and it is a success too. The music video is based on the Italian film "The Last Emperor". It is the first American rock video ever shot in its entirety in the People's Republic of China. This single peaks at number 1 on Billboard's "Modern Rock Tracks", and also in Europe, Bolivia and Latvia Singles Chart. At this time, 30 Seconds to Mars won also Best Artist at the TRL Awards Italy, Best Rock Artist at the MTV Europe Music Awards, Best of 2007 at the Fuse Awards and Best International Artist at the Bandit Rock Awards.
The fourth single from the album is "A Beautiful Lie" and it is very success. The video is a montage of images of the Greenland, with scenes of the band playing on an iceberg. The single won the Video Star at the MTV Asia Awards and at the MTV Europe Music Awards, and in 2009 it was certified gold by MTV International.

SQL slammer worm

The SQL slammer worm (also known as W32.SQLExp.Worm) was a highly damaging computer worm that spread on the internet in early 2003.
The SQL worm mainly attacked computers that had Microsoft SQL Server 2000 or Microsoft Desktop Engine 2000 on them. The worm also produces a Denial-of-Service attack on some websites and computers because it sends too much data.
In June 2002, Microsoft released a patch that fixed the weakness that the SQL worm attacked. However, many people did not fix the weakness. In January 2003, the worm was released. Within ten minutes of its release, it had attacked and infected 75,000 internet servers. Bank of America was one of the largest companies affected by the worm. Many of its ATM's would not work for consumers. The damage got worse, and on January 25, 2003, the worm cause a global internet slowdown. The worm was reported to have interfered with 911 calls and was responsible for many canceled flights.
During its lifetime in 2003, the SQL worm caused about 1 billion U.S Dollars in damage.

Computer worm

A computer worm is a kind of malware that is able to copy itself, and spread. Unlike a computer virus, this is done without changing files on a computer, and without affecting the boot sector of media. Worms do not need human help to reproduce. Worms spread over networks, or on removable media like USB flash drives. They almost always need a helper program that is able to access the network, or that executes when a new medium is inserted. 
In that way, a Worm could start a program to send electronic mail, and send itself on to all the addresses in the address book of the email application. A very famous worm that appeared in 2000 was called ILOVEYOU (or "Love Letter"), it sent a simple mail with the subject ILOVEYOU, and an attachment of a document that contained the worm code. 
Worms usually do not cause direct damage to a system. But they consume memory and network bandwidth, slowing down the computer. This makes it almost impossible to work with. Other examples of Worms are CodeRed and Sircam.

Royal Rumble (2009)

Royal Rumble (2009) was a wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) made by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It took place in Detroit, Michigan at the Joe Louis Arena. The event was held on January 22, 2009.
The event had the 22nd annual Royal Rumble match as the main event, which Randy Orton won. One of the matches was Jeff Hardy defending his WWE Championship against Edge. Another was John Cena defending his World Heavyweight Championship against John "Bradshaw" Layfield with his employee Shawn Michaels. A third match was Jack Swagger defending his ECW Championship against Matt Hardy. The last match was Beth Phoenix defending her WWE Women's Championship against Melina.
450,000 paid to see the event. This was down from 533,000 the year before.
The main match in the Rumble was the yearly Royal Rumble match. The match starts with two wrestlers with another wrestler coming to the ring every 90 seconds until all 30 have entered. The match ends when one wrestler remains in the ring. This is after all 29 other wrestlers have been eliminated by being thrown over the top ring rope and having both feet touch the floor. The winner was given a championship match for the WWE, World Heavyweight, or ECW Championship at WrestleMania XXV.
The main rivalry from the Raw brand was John "Bradshaw" Layfield (JBL) challenging John Cena for the World Heavyweight Championship. JBL earned his championship match against Cena after winning a Fatal Four-Way elimination match on the December 29, 2008 episode of "Raw" by beating Chris Jericho, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels.
Another rivalry from the Raw brand was Melina challenging Beth Phoenix for her WWE Women's Championship in a singles match. Melina won the chance to face Phoenix on the December 29, 2008 episode of "Raw" by winning a battle royal.
The main rivalry from the SmackDown brand going into the Royal Rumble was Jeff Hardy and Edge fighting over the WWE Championship. At WWE's last pay-per-view event, Armageddon, Hardy defeated Edge and Triple H in a Triple Threat match, a match with three wrestlers, to win the WWE Championship. On the January 2, 2009 episode of "SmackDown", Vickie Guerrero said that Edge would face Hardy for the WWE title at the Royal Rumble.
ECW's main rivalry was Jack Swagger and Matt Hardy fighting over the ECW Championship. On the January 13, 2009 episode of "ECW", Swagger beat Hardy to win the ECW Championship. On the January 16 episode of "SmackDown", it was announced that Swagger would defend the ECW title against Hardy in a match at the Royal Rumble.
The first match of the night had Jack Swagger fight Matt Hardy for the ECW Championship. Swagger was the defending champion. The match began having both wrestlers countering (reversing) each other's moves. This continued until Swagger hurt Hardy's shoulder. Swagger targeted this part of the body on Matt for the rest of the match. Swagger won the match by pin after hitting his finisher (the signature move that he used to finish a match) on him, a gutwrench powerbomb. As a result, Swagger remained the ECW Champion.
The next match was for the WWE Women's Championship. The champion, Beth Phoenix was set to defend her title against Melina. The match saw Phoenix in control for a lot of the match with Beth focusing on Melina's legs. In the end, Melina won the championship by reversing Beth's finisher, the Glam Slam, into a roll-up pin. This resulted in Melina becoming the new WWE Women's Champion.
In the third match, John Cena faced JBL to defend his World Heavyweight Championship. JBL's employee, Shawn Michaels, came to the ring with JBL. When the referee was knocked out, Shawn entered the ring and hit his finisher, Sweet Chin Music, on both JBL and Cena leaving them in the ring on the mat (floor of the ring) but with JBL's arm on top of Cena, which is a type of pin. But before the referee woke up Cena got up and hit his finisher, the Attitude Adjustment, to pin JBL and keep his championship.
The fourth match of the night had Jeff Hardy fight against Edge for the WWE Championship. Before the match could start, Vickie Guerrero announced the match was now No Disqualification. Edge then said that he would have Chavo Guerrero outside the ring. Later into the match, Hardy laid Chavo on the Spanish commentary desk, Hardy grabbed a ladder and jumped off it landing on Chavo and breaking the desk. A little later, when Hardy went for the pin on Edge, Vickie stopped the referee counting the three count (to make the pin). Hardy's brother Matt then ran down to the ring to help his brother. At first it appeared Matt was setting up Edge for a con-chair-to, but he instead attacked his brother turning heel. Edge came to and pinned Jeff to win the WWE Championship.
The last match of the night, or the main event, was the Royal Rumble match. Rey Mysterio and John Morrison started the Rumble. The final six people left in the match were The Big Show, The Undertaker, Triple H and The Legacy (Cody Rhodes, Ted DiBiase, and Randy Orton). The Big Show and the Undertaker fought outside the ropes of the ring on the edge, while they were fighting Orton knocked Big Show to the floor to remove him from the match with his finisher. Big Show out of anger pulled the Undertaker down eliminating him. This left Legacy and Triple H. Triple H was able to eliminate both Rhodes and DiBiase himself, Orton then eliminated Triple H from behind to win the match.

Wikipedia has many rules. Instead of following every rule, it is acceptable to use common sense as you go about editing. Being too wrapped up in rules can cause you to lose perspective, so there are times when it is better to . 
Even if a change violates the exact wording of a rule, it might still be a good change. Likewise, just because something is not forbidden in a written rule doesn't mean it's a good idea (e.g., ). The "principle" of the rules is more important than the letter.
Invoking the principle of on its own will not convince anyone that you were right, so you will need to try to prove to the community that your actions improved the encyclopedia. A skilled application of this concept should ideally fly under the radar, and not be noticed at all.

Solid Snake

Solid Snake is a fictional stealth character seen in Metal Gear games by Konami. Introduced in the 1987 video games Metal Gear, and Metal Gear Solid, created by series creator Hideo Kojima, Solid Snake is a combination of a spy, special operations agent, and mercenary who works for FOXHOUND.
Solid Snake (aka David) is one of three clones made in a secret project to clone the world's greatest soldier. His childhood is a mystery, but he is known to have fought in the Gulf War, and maybe a few others before that. After the war ended, he joined the Secret Organization known as FOXHOUND. While he was a member of this group, he discovered the existence of a new war machine, called Metal Gear. This is a staple throughout the series, as the title suggests. He fights a new type of Metal Gear in every game. 
In the fourth release in the Metal Gear Solid series, Solid Snake's codename id changed to "Old Snake" as a reference to his old age. In reality, he is not actually as old as he seems. A side effect of the cloning that created him, was an aging process that would speed up when he reached a certain age, around the time a normal human's body starts to weaken. It should be noted, that another side effect of the cloning, is that he is unable to have children.
Though Snake is not a Nintendo character, he makes an appearance in "Super Smash Bros. Brawl" as a secret character. If used right, his can be one of the best attack sets.

Food web

A food web is similar to a food chain but larger,and it is a diagram that combines many food chains into one picture.
Food webs show how plants and animals are connected in many ways to help them all survive, unlike food chains that just follow one path. 
For example, a tree produces acorns - this is called the producer. Mice, squirrels, and insects eat these acorns and because there are many mice, the weasels, snakes and raccoons have food. With insects in the acorns, other predators would be attracted (like skunks or opossums) and therefore, foxes, hawks or owls could all find food. Food webs can be effected in many ways considering the urban areas of major countries are taking no action and care. It uses arrows to show the energy relationships among organisms

I am new to this site and would like to change my username User:Deviceanywhere to something closer to my email. I have checked, and this name (SpyGuy6789) is available. I had originally chosen the original username for convenience of the entry I had posted, but since joining have realized you can have multiple entries posted to one name. So, hopefully this will clear up confusion on that entry. I hope I put this request in the correct section. Thanks for your help! ()

Ozone layer

The ozone layer is a layer of ozone high up in the Earth's atmosphere stratosphere. In the region between about 10 kilometres and about 50 kilometres above ground, the atmosphere contains more ozone (O). The exact amount of ozone that can be found varies, the seasons influence it; it is also different in different places on the Earth.
Over the last hundred years the ozone layer has been damaged by man-made chemicals, especially ones called CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons). CFCs were used for various purposes. They have been replaced by other substances for most applications. These CFCs are broken down in the upper atmosphere where they react with the ozone. This causes ozone depletion. 
The ozone layer was discovered in 1913 by the French physicists Charles Fabry and Henri Buisson. Its properties were explored in detail by the British meteorologist G. M. B. Dobson, who developed a simple spectrophotometer, the Dobsonmeter. This tool could be used to measure the ozone levels found in the stratosphere from the ground. Between 1928 and 1958 Dobson established a worldwide network of ozone monitoring stations. Most of these stations are still in use today. The "Dobson unit", a convenient measure of the total amount of ozone in a column overhead, is named in his honor.

Dolly (sheep)

Dolly (5 July 1996 – 14 February 2003) was a sheep, remarkable in being the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell. 
A somatic cell is a regular body cell, not an egg cell. The nucleus of the somatic cell was removed and put into an unfertilised egg cell. The process is called somatic cell nuclear transfer. She was cloned at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, Scotland. It took 277 attempts to create Dolly. The success rate when cloning animals is very low. 
The cell used as the donor for the cloning of Dolly was taken from a mammary gland. The production of a healthy clone therefore proved that a cell taken from a specific part of the body could recreate a whole individual. She was cloned so she did not need any male cells to fertilize the egg and mature it. She only has one parent.
Dolly lived for her life at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh. There she was bred with a Welsh Mountain ram and had six lambs in total called; Bonnie, Rosie, Lucy, Sally, Darcy and Cotton. 
On 14 February 2003, Dolly was euthanised because she had a lung disease and severe arthritis.

Fozzie Bear is a character from "The Muppet Show". He is a cinnamon-colored bear. He wears a hat, and a pink and white tie. Fozzie is a comedian, so his job is to tell jokes. He is famous for not telling very good jokes. He is often heckled and insulted by two old men, Statler and Waldorf. A phrase that Fozzie is known to say is "wakka wakka wakka." The phrase has no meaning, but is usually used after a joke to make the joke seem funnier. Fozzie is a fairly good friend to Kermit the Frog, although he does annoy Kermit at times. He seems to annoy Miss Piggy much more often.
Fozzie Bear was first played by Frank Oz. He is now played by Eric Jacobson.

Dan Morgan (bushranger)

Dan Morgan (1830 - 9 April 1865) was an Australian bushranger. His real name was John Fuller, but he may have had his mother's surname and been known as Daniel Owen. He was also called John Smith, "Down-the-river Jack" and "Billy the Native". His most famous name was “Mad Dan Morgan.” He robbed people in the Riverina area, but was seen as a friend of the poor workers.
Dan Morgan was born in Campbelltown, New South Wales in 1830. His mother was Mary Owen, known as "The Gipsy". As a small child he was adopted by “Jack the Welshman”, a travelling hawker from Appin. He went to school in Appin. As a young teenager, he hit a policeman and was put in Berrima Gaol for six months. He went to Victoria to look for gold in the 1850’s. In 1854 he was arrested for armed robbery at Castlemaine, Victoria. Judge Redmond Barry (the same judge who sentenced Ned Kelly) sent him to Pentridge Gaol for twelve years, the first two years spent in chains. He was also kept on the prison ship "Success". He was released after six years and went back to Appin. He worked as a stockman at Wagga Wagga.
In 1860 he stole horses from two squatters (farmers) at Whitfield, Victoria in the King River valley. The squatters, Evans and Bond, followed Morgan's tracks to where he was camped. They shot Morgan with their guns, but he was able to escape.
In July 1865, Morgan and his friend, “German Bill”, began to rob from farms around Gundagai, New South Wales. They stole food, gun powder, guns, watches, and horses. There is story that he killed German Bill, but there is no proof. Morgan robbed the police magistrate from Wagga Wagga, Henry Bayliss. Morgan said he would not shoot him as long as he didn’t report the robbery to the police. Bayliss told the police at Urana, and a search party was sent from Wagga Wagga. With the help of black trackers (Indigenous Australians with tracking skills), the police found Morgan’s camp. In the shooting that followed, Morgan shot Bayliss in the hand and shoulder. Morgan escaped into the bush. After more robberies, the government put a reward of £500 for the capture of Morgan.
In June 1864, Morgan went to Round Hill station (farm), near the town of Culcairn, New South Wales, where he locked all the workers up. He made the squatter (owner), Watson, give them all extra alcohol. When they asked him about bushranging, he became angry. He wanted to kill Watson, but after Watson's wife stood in front of her husband, Morgan shot him in the hand. He then told farm worker John McLean to go and get help, but quickly changed his mind and shot McLean in the back. McLean was badly wounded. Morgan was upset by this, and stayed with him even though the police were searching for him. McLean died from his injuries three days after being shot. One week later, June 24 1864, he met up with two policemen near Tumbarumba. Morgan shot police Sergeant McGinnerty dead. The other man, Constable Churchley, escaped. After the killings, the government increased the reward to £1000. In September, another policeman, Sergeant Smyth, was shot and killed. Morgan said that he fired the shot. In March 1865, the government made him an outlaw, which meant he could be shot and killed by anyone without warning. 
Morgan often became angry, sometimes without warning. Farmers in the area were scared he would set their crops and haystacks on fire. He would be very nasty to any farmer that did not treat their workers properly. In 1865 he held up a farm at Mohanga. He made the farmer, Bobby Rand, give all the workers a drink, then made him dance for them until he collapsed.
A Victorian newspaper said that if he came to Victoria, the police there would soon catch him. He went to the King River area of Victoria and began to rob farms. He wanted to get back at Evans who had shot him several years earlier. On April 8 1865, he held up the Peechelba station (farm). He made them cook and serve him dinner. One of the maids was able to escape and tell the neighbors what was happening. By 3.00 am, the police had arrived from Wangaratta and together with workers from nearby farms, they surrounded Peechelba. When he came out of the farm house next morning he was shot in the back by a stockman, Jack Quinlan. He died at 2.00pm.
Police Superintendent Cobham took Morgan's body back to Wangaratta and put it on display. Dr. Henry, of Benalla, cut off Morgan’s beard, tearing off skin as he cut it. Henry cut off Morgan’s head and sent it to Professor George Halford at Melbourne University for examination. People were horrified by the idea of Morgan's body being cut into pieces; the government was forced to have an inquiry. Cobham got into a lot of trouble and was given a less important job.

<doc id="164332" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164332" title="Stop Stansted Expansion">
Stop Stansted Expansion

Stop Stansted Expansion (SSE) is a pressure group established in 2002. It was originally a working group of the North West Essex and East Herts Preservation Association, in response to the Government's consultation on expanding UK airports and, particularly, expansion plans for Stansted Airport defined in 2001. It has around 7,500 members and registered online supporters and its campaign director is "Carol Barbone".
The group's objective is to "restrict the development of Stansted Airport within tight limits that are truly sustainable and, in this way, to protect the quality of life of its supporters over wide areas of Essex, Hertfordshire and Suffolk, to preserve local heritage and to protect the natural environment."
The organisation has already delayed the time-frame for second runway plans for Stansted by four years (from 2011 to 2015).
If the plans went ahead, there would be climate change effects. The predicted annual equivalent carbon dioxide emissions ( they are around 5 million tonnes a year at present) are 12 million tonnes annually with full use of the existing runway and up to 23 million tonnes a year with a second runway.
On the 9th October 2008, the UK Government approved an increase in Stansted's permitted passenger throughput from 25 million passengers per annum (mppa) to 35mppa using the existing runway following a Public Enquiry. Stop Stansted Expansion (SSE) has described this decision as "entirely predictable, cynical and unjustified". 
After this announcement, on 14 November, Stop Stansted Expansion lodged an Appeal with the High Court.
A key part of the campaign against the second runway is to stimulate letters of objection to the application. Uttlesford District Council has received over nine thousand representations to date with many more expected to follow.
Passenger traffic at Stansted is falling sharply. The airport handled 6% fewer passenger in 2008 than in the previous year (22.3m passengers last year compared to 23.8m passengers in 2007). SSE therefore says that "increasing passenger numbers from 25mppa to 35mppa will not make any difference in the short term. Indeed, with the recent dramatic deterioration in the economic situation – both domestically and internationally – the UK is entering uncharted territory with regard to the future demand for air travel." 
BAA's Plans to get through the Public Inquiry as fast as possible for their application for a second Stansted runway (in six months) have been condemned by Stop Stansted Expansion (SSE). It began 15 April 2009.
The news that the Inspector appointed by the Government is looking to conduct the Inquiry at a "breakneck" pace was revealed in a note from the Planning Inspectorate issued ahead of the Pre Inquiry Meeting held on 10 November 2008, when the Inquiry programme and procedures were discussed at a public session. A further programming meeting is to be held on 19 January 2009.
"Running parallel sessions examining different subjects in different Inquiry rooms at the same time would severely compromise the community's ability to participate fully in the Inquiry" SSE says. "It would be impossible to conduct a fair and proper examination of BAA's plans by effectively excluding community representation by SSE and parish councils who are planning to play a leading role, said "Carol Barbone", campaign director."

Domain Name System

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a system used to convert a computer's host name into an IP address on the Internet. For example, if a computer needs to communicate with the web server "example.net", your computer needs the IP address of the web server "example.net". It is the job of the DNS to convert the host name to the IP address of the web server. DNS is defined in RFC 1034 and RFC 1035 and use the UDP Port 53 or TCP Port 53.
Domain names are made up of one or more parts, or "labels" that are joined and kept separate by dots, such as codice_1.

The Eyrieux River is a river in Europe. It is a tributary of the Rhône River. This means that it flows into the Rhône River.
The Eyrieux River runs for . It passes through three different landscapes. A plateau is found above a commune called Le Cheylard. This plateau is marked by the sugarloaf cones of old volcanoes. This land is mostly used for cattle and sheep. In its middle section, down as far as Saint-Sauveur-de-Montagut and Les Ollières-sur-Eyrieux, the river is a torrent. This means that it flows very quickly and roughly. It has a lot of flash floods. The power made by this torrent was used first for silk mills. Now it is used for micro-hydroelectricity production. It is also a popular spot for canoeists. The river never dries up in summer, because there are many dams and barrages that give it a steady flow. The lower section to the Rhône, at Beauchastel and La Voulte-sur-Rhône, opens into a valley. This valley is used for farming. Peach orchards are commonly grown here.

Gary Lewis (born Gary Harold Lee Levitch on July 31, 1945 in Newark, New Jersey) is an American musician. He is the son of actor/director and comedian Jerry Lewis. His longtime band was called The Playboys.
Lewis and his band had several hit records during the 1960s, including "This Diamond Ring", "She's Just My Style", "Save Your Heart For Me", "Count Me In", and "Everybody Loves A Clown". Lewis played drums onstage, but Jim Keltner often played drums on the Playboys recordings. Most of their records were produced by Snuff Garrett. Lewis was also the band's lead singer.
Lewis included a tribute to his father in the song "Time Stands Still", imitating Jerry Lewis's familiar comic voice on the record, and he and the Playboys performed the theme song to his 1966 comedy film "Way... Way Out".
When Lewis was into the United States Army in 1967, the Playboys disbanded. After he served in the Army, Lewis had no more hit records, but continued to perform at concerts and charity shows, including some of the Muscular Dystrophy Association's annual telethons, hosted by Jerry Lewis.

Alois Alzheimer

Alois Alzheimer (14 June 1864 – 19 December 1915) was a German psychiatrist. He is credited with the first published case of "presenile dementia", which Emil Kraepelin would later identify as Alzheimer's disease.
On 25th of November 1901, Alzheimer started treating a new patient, called Auguste Deter. Auguste was married, and her husband brought her to the clinic, because within a year she had changed very much. She had started to become jealous, and was unable to perform simple household tasks. Alzheimer found out that the patient had little knowledge of where she was or about the time of day or the week. She also remembered few things about her life. When she was asked a question, the answer often had little to do with the question. Auguste Deter's mood changed rapidly. Alzheimer had seen similar symptoms with other patients he treated, but generally these were over 70 years old; Auguste Deter was only 51. Several times, Auguste Deter stated that she knew that she "had lost herself" and that she "was helpless". For this reason, Alzheimer originally said that this was the "disease of forgetting". Deter died in 1906.

Mudskipper

Mudskippers are a type of fish. They are part of a fish family known as tribe Periophthalmini), which is in the family, or type of, Gobiidae (Gobies). They are amphibious fish, which means that they can use their pectoral fins to "walk" on land. Because they are amphibious, they are, unlike most fish, adapted to intertidal habitats. These are places where the tide of the ocean comes in and out. Most fish that live in these habitats hide under wet seaweed or in tidal pools to not get pulled away when the tide goes out. Mudskippers are active when they are out of the water. They eat and interact with each other. For example, they defend their territories.
They are found in places that are tropical, subtropical and temperate. Places like these include the Indo-Pacific and the Atlantic coast of Africa.
Mudskippers are different from their relatives, the gobies, in many ways. Gobies live only in the, which means they live both on land and in water. They have made many adaptations to live on the land. These include:
 This way of breathing is like how amphibians breathe. It is known as cutaneous air breathing. Another important adaptation that helps breathing while out of the water are their enlarged gill chambers. They keep a bubble of air there. These large gill chambers close tightly when the fish is above water. This keeps the gills moist and lets them to function. They act like a scuba diver's cylinders. They give oxygen for breathing also while on land.
Even when their burrow is underwater, mudskippers have an air pocket inside it. This lets them to breathe where there is little oxygen in the water.
The genus (a group of closely related species) "Periophthalmus" is by far the most diverse and widespread group of mudskipper. There are eighteen different types. "Periophthalmus argentilineatus" is one of the most widespread and well known species. It can be found in mangrove ecosystems and mudflats of East Africa and Madagascar east through the Sundarbans of Bengal, South East Asia to Northern Australia, southeast China and southern Japan, up to Samoa and Tonga Islands.
It grows to a length of about 9.5 cm and is a carnivorous (meat-eating) opportunist feeder, which means it will eat anything it comes upon. It feeds on small prey such as small crabs and other arthropods. Another species, "Periophthalmus barbarus", is the only oxudercine goby that lives in the coastal areas of western Africa (Murdy, 1989).

Return statement

A return statement is the information that part of a computer program gives to another part. In object-oriented programming, the term return is used by methods to perform an output. Much like when a button is pressed on a vending machine then the item you bought (hopefully) comes out, when an object performs a method, then something is returned. Specifically what is returned depends on an special identifier called a return type.
A return type is a required part of any method, because it tells the computer what the user wants to be returned to whatever called (used) the method. If an integer was expected, then typically the method would have a return type of codice_1, as int is the common name for an integer in computer science. There are several return types that can be found to most programming languages.
Means a method returns an integer, a whole number.
Means a method returns a double value. This is the default method of using numbers with decimal points.

Method (computer science)

In object-oriented programming, a method is a part of an object. A method allows the object to perform an action, whether this action is to modify itself or to return a value. An example is:
public int getOne() {
This syntax is the same in different programming languages such as Java and C#.
The codice_1 identifier means that this method is publicly accessible, that anyone is allowed to use this. In comparison, a method may be codice_2 or sometimes codice_3, the latter of which means only specific parts of the same program are allowed to use this method, and never a human user. A privately accessible method only allows the object it belongs to, to edit it. This is used to give data security.
The codice_4 identifier means that the return type is an integer value.

From the Earth to the Moon is a book by Jules Verne.
He tells of the adventures of three men, the Americans Barbicane and Nicholl, and one French man, Ardan. They want to go to the moon, and to do this, they make a very big cannon, with a very big "bullet". The bullet is the spaceship. They get caught in the moons orbit and the story ends there.
Before he died, Verne gave the manuscript to his nephew, telling him to look after it. "I'm sure that you will see travel to the moon. You will be able to judge my prediction".

Welcome to another QandA column! This time is interviewing ! Lets read all about him...
Yotcmdr: "Okay, First things first, tell us about yourself, where you are from, what do you do (ie School/Work)?"
Bluegoblin7: OK, well on-wiki I'm known as Bluegoblin7, and my real name is Jack Gordon. I live in Derbyshire in the UK and I was born in London. I'm currently in in secondary education (GCSEs) and I'm studying Drama, ICT and Geography as my personal choices.
Yot: Interesting! 
Yot: "What got you involved in editing Wikipedia?"
Bluegoblin7: The first edit I remember making to Wikipedia was as an IP. I didn't know anything about it and saw the edit button. I clicked it, and went on to delete a large amount of text and insert gibberish. That article was .
BG: I then decided to create an account in Feb 2007.
BG: And joined a wikiproject.
Yot: Mhhh, you naughty vandal!
BG: ("laughs") Didn't most people start out as a vandal? And it wasn't intentional!
Yot: I don't know, I didn't!
BG: However, i didn't do much for a few months, before i massively expanded and got more involved. Everything sort of branched from there!
Yot: Good, good!
BG: I became active at SEWP in October 2008 after getting disillusioned with the English project
Yot: Ok!
Yot: Very well, let's continue
Yot: "What sort of things are you most involved in, with Wikipedia?"
BG: At the SEWP I'm most active with this newsletter, Simple News, our DYK section, and I also run 3 (Soon to be 5!) bots
BG: I also create articles, participate in discussions and revert vandalism, and I'm active in our (V)GA areas and help clerk there mainly.
Yot: OK, good
Yot: And are there any topics that interest you particularly?
BG: Yes, my favourite topic is transport, primarly in Britain and particularly heritage tramways and historical tramways; also British Rail.
Yot: Great!
BG: I also have an interest in BBC television programmes as well as English, in particular novels and novelists
Yot: Really, which BBC television programmes?
BG: Well BBC wise things like Spooks, Hustle, Silent Witness, etc.
Yot:" Is there anything you'd change at SEWP?"
BG: Yes, there's an awful lot I'd like to change at SEWP at the moment.
Yot: Could you expand?
BG: As I'm sure everyone is aware we have recently lost several of our best editors and I'm sure many more are on their way out...
BG: This is due to all the drama that has plagued the wiki recently, RfA, FR, Tharnton etc.
BG: No wiki is gonna be drama free.
BG: But we can minimise it by certain users just not making a fuss at any little thing
Yot: Yes, I agree.
Yot: "Is there anything you'd like to add about yourself, something uncommon you know or that you can do?" 
BG: Erm... not really I'd just like to plug and YourWiki and also mention if you need help or a bot task running... just 
give me a shout!
Yot: Ok, Thanks you very much for your time.
BG: You're welcome!
Thanks BG! Look out for more QandA interviews soon! 13:34, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

Severus Snape

Severus Snape is a character from J.K. Rowling's fictional book series Harry Potter. 
Snape is the Potions master at Hogwarts in the series. He is also known to be a Death Eater but after Voldemort started hunting Lily Evans, the woman Snape had loved since he was a child, he asked Albus Dumbledore to find a safe place for the Potters because he knew Voldemort wanted to kill their son, Harry Potter. As Dumbledore was not able to save the Potters, Snape's sorrow was real and extremely deep, he gained Dumbledore's trust. Snape was loyal to Dumbledore after this event. Snape killed Dumbledore in the sixth book on Dumbledore's request. Voldemort believed Snape killed him because Voldemort had planned Snape to do that. Snape had let it slip in the third book that Remus Lupin was a werewolf. 
Snape didn't kill himself after Lily's death only because of the green eyes he had loved that Lily's son had inherited from her. Just before Snape's death in the seventh book Snape asks Harry to do the last thing for him.
The last thing Snape's eyes ever saw were Lily's green eyes. Later, Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley named their youngest son after Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape. Harry confesses to his son Albus Severus that Severus Snape was the bravest man he ever knew even though while still at school, Snape had been the teacher that Harry had hated the most because of Snape's bad behaviour towards Harry. Snape was so mean to Harry because of Harry's father, James Potter, that had bullied Snape while they were at Hogwarts. Snape was more than a cruel, heartless death eater but rather a brave and sincere victim to the perils of love in the reign of a power obsessed and heartless dictator. 
In all of the Harry Potter movies, Snape is played by Alan Rickman.

Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration

Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration or Hallervorden Spatz disease is a rare disease primarily characterized by extrapyramidal symptoms and dementia, or extreme forgetfullness. Hallervorden-Spatz disease is degenerative brain disease, meaning the longer a person has it the worse the effects become. Scientists think it is caused by a build up of too much Iron in the brain. 
The effects of the disease usually start at a young age and often result in a quick death. Some effects include:

<doc id="164511" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164511" title="St Matthew Passion">
St Matthew Passion

The St. Matthew Passion () ) is a musical composition written by Johann Sebastian Bach. The words tell the story of Jesus’s death on the cross as told in chapters 26 and 27 of the Book of St Matthew in the Bible. The work is for a choir, solo voices and orchestra. Both the choir and the orchestra are divided into two sections: Chorus 1 and Chorus 2, Orchestra 1 and Orchestra 2.
The words are from the Bible and by the poet Picander. There were other composers who also wrote works called "St Matthew Passion", the most famous being Heinrich Schütz. However, Bach’s "St Matthew Passion " is thought by many musicians to be the greatest choral work ever written. Two other very great choral works by Bach are his "St John Passion " and "Mass in B minor ". 
The tradition of singing the story of Jesus' passion during Holy Week (the week before Easter) goes back many hundreds of years to a time when a priest would sing the story instead of speaking it. Later a tradition developed of letting it be sung by a choir. During the Baroque period the Passion oratorio developed. Bach's St. Matthew Passion, written in 1727, is the most famous work in this tradition. It was probably first performed on Good Friday (11 April) 1727 in the Thomaskirche in Leipzig, where Bach was Kapellmeister. He made some changes to it by 1736 and performed it again on 30 March 1736. After that it was almost completely forgotten until long after Bach’s death. Even Bach’s music in general was forgotten by most people. In 1829 the composer Felix Mendelssohn discovered the music of the "St Matthew Passion " and decided to perform a short version of it in Berlin. It immediately became extremely popular with the public and from then on Bach has always remained recognized as one of the greatest of all composers.
The words of Bach’s "St Matthew Passion " are partly taken straight from the Bible (Matthew Chapters 26-27) and partly made up by the poet Picander. The words from the Bible are used to tell the basic story. They are sung to recitative (music in speech rhythm) by a tenor soloist who is known as the evangelist (Matthew was an “evangelist” because he preached the message of Jesus). The words spoken by Jesus are sung by a baritone or bass soloist. The evangelist is accompanied by the continuo (an organ and a cello, double bass or bassoon). Jesus is accompanied by the strings.
Between the sections of recitatives there are arias, each of which is sung by one of the four soloists: a soprano, an alto, a tenor and a bass. The arias often have an introductory movement called “arioso” which in musical style is something between a recitative and an aria. The arias are accompanied by the orchestra, often with one instrument playing an important solo. The words of the arioso and arias comment on what is happening in the story and describe what is going on in the people’s minds. 
The choir, divided into two sections (“double choir”), sing some movements in which they represent the crowd of people in the story. Some of these movements, such as the opening one, are quite long, others are very short indeed. In some of these movements there is a vocal soloist, and the choir are commenting on what the soloist is singing about. In addition to the main choir there is a small choir which sings a chorale tune on top of the music during the first movement (this is called a “ripieno”). Sometimes a boys’ choir is used for this.
There are also several chorales which are sung by the whole choir. These are like hymn tunes. It is likely that in Bach’s time the congregation would have joined in singing these, as they were chorales which were often sung at church services.
During some of the choral movements there are very small sections for a solo voice. These represent one person from the crowd. These may be sung by soloists from the choir. So, as well as Jesus, there are small parts for Judas, Peter, two high priests, Pontius Pilate, Pilate's wife, two witnesses and two "ancillae" (maids). These small parts can be sung by different soloists, but in some performances one soloist (possibly one who is also singing the arias) may take several of these parts.
In the tradition of these musical Passions the Resurrection is not mentioned at all. The story ends with the chorus shedding tears after Jesus has been put to death.
The instruments in the orchestra are string instruments (violins, violas, cellos and double basses), organs (one for each choir), two flutes, two oboes and bassoon. Orchestra I plays with Choir I and Orchestra II plays with Choir II. There are some extra instruments as well: two recorders, three different kinds of oboe and a viola da gamba.
Bach’s "St Matthew Passion" takes nearly 3 ½ hours if it is performed without any cuts. It is divided into two parts. There is usually a long interval between each part so that musicians and audience can have a meal before coming back refreshed for the second part.
The "St Matthew Passion " and the "St John Passion " are both very great works. They are different in character. The "St John Passion" is very dramatic, enjoying the drama of the story. The "St Matthew Passion " is more gentle and thoughtful, although it also has some dramatic moments.

The St John Passion () is a musical composition by Johann Sebastian Bach. The words tell the story of Jesus’s death on the cross as told in the Book of St John in the Bible. The work is for a choir, solo voices and orchestra.
The "St. John Passion" was first performed in 1724 in the St Nicholas Church, Leipzig. The words are from three sources: the Bible (telling the story), by two poets from Hamburg, mostly by Barthold Heinrich Brockes, and from chorales which were well-known to German church goers at the time. There were other composers who also wrote works called "St John Passion", the most famous being Heinrich Schütz. However, Bach’s "St John Passion " is thought by many musicians to be one of the greatest choral works ever written.

Bach did not plan the Mass in B minor as one continuous work. Parts of it were composed in 1724. He put the movements together just before his death. It is one of the greatest musical works ever written.

I know isn't related to "this" project but it is very important to me and I would like you help. I would like to know if anyone has an idea how I get this posted on en for everyone to see?--  20:25, 23 January 2009 (UTC)
ChristianMan, I have tried for a long time not to comment on this, but I think that you have pushed things too far. You have gone around to every active users' talk page and advertised about your apology note. I wish I would not have to say this but you are creating spam. Also, your apology to enWP is your business, not ours. We (the community) did nothing that got you banned/blocked from editing the english wikipedia. We do not need your apology. Its the people you owe an apology, needs the apology. -- 03:21, 24 January 2009 (UTC)
Alright, all. I know that I just got through the whole 10th RfA thing and all, but I have come up with a solution to everyones' problems. If you guys don't trust me enough to be an administrator all of the time, how about letting me be an administrator temporarily? That way, you can see how I would act if I were an administrator and you guys get to have the knowledge that I won't be an administrator forever. Instead, I get to be an administrator for a period of time and you guys get to completely critize and be very speculative about my abilities as an administrator. I believe that this is a fair compromise between the two sides. What do you guys think about this? 02:20, 24 January 2009 (UTC)
<outdent>It sounds like a good idea. () 22:24, 24 January 2009 (UTC)
Is there a way we can add a link to the "getting around" tool bar to the left linking to the Administrators notice board, and maybe one to WP:VIP too?--  02:25, 24 January 2009 (UTC)
<- If you're looking to add a link to your sidebar, should work. With regard to new users, in my newbie-to-here opinion, many new users who saw vandalism and the link would report it without going through the warnings, and wouldn't know what should be sent to the admin's noticeboard. Simple talk, on the other hand, can help or give directions on any topic, rather than linking new users to such structured noticeboards. () 01:45, 25 January 2009 (UTC)
There seems to be a growing number of rollbackers in the simple wiki community. Some of the current rollbackers have been active or semi-active users who have perviously attempted to an RfA, but failed. Now many users in here and the enWP, are using the rollback tool as an alternative, or stepping-stone to adminship. While there hasn't been any abuse of the tool (thank god!) the current number of rollbackers outnumber sysops, although I don't think that is anything serious. -- 14:47, 26 January 2009 (UTC)
Please, please fix that bot that is reverting the articles. Each editing is reverted. Thanks.-- () 16:30, 26 January 2009 (UTC)
Hi there all. As you all might have known, there are several open proposals for VGAs, GAs, and both VGA and GA demotions. 
Furthermore, all three of these processes are lacking participation. If the amount of participation doesn't improve soon, we may be looking at the possibility that we don't have enough active users to sustain any of these processes in the future. I am urging any active user here to please become more active in these three processes as they could very well not be able to work on here. Cheers, 16:46, 26 January 2009 (UTC)
Since no one will come here to ask us our opinions, I was wondering what you all thought about this?
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7851400.stm
Would the implementations work? Activity would be slowed, but vandalism would be eradicated. Opinionate me! -- 19:42, 26 January 2009 (UTC)
Wouldn't this make administrators kinda pointless then, because no vandalism means no rollback, no protection, and almost no deletions... 19:50, 26 January 2009 (UTC)
English Wikinews also has it. I was surprised the first time I edited and it said "Draft. 1 change awaits review", but after reading what it meant and casually editing there, I like it and don't mind that my changes aren't added immediately. I also feel a sense of "someone approves of my edits" when they are sighted or there's more a respectful give-and-take if a reviewer disagrees, due to the slight hierarchy. (I could edit more often and become a reviewer myself if I wished, but choose not to.)
There are of course pros and cons, discussed extensively at , and en is not simple. But I think a discussion on *why* you think it sucks or rocks would help more than voting or standing your ground. 
My opinion is I like it on Wikinews but I'm not experienced enough here to say whether it might be more trouble than it's worth. (I mean on Simple.) () 20:22, 28 January 2009 (UTC)
Like it or lump it, this project needs another bureaucrat. Julian could have been promoted hours ago, but is sat waiting because two bureaucrats simply doesn't cover the time needed. I've already had to delete a couple of pages for him on his behalf, which he is perfectly capable of doing himself.
Normally, I would submit an RFB myself, but I have doubts about running, because I'll probably fail. To be honest though, no admin seems to have the ability to pass one. But, I still have a glimmer of hope. I'd like you to imagine I had submitted a request. Try to look past the irrelevant things, but do concentrate on the one question: would Majorly make a good bcrat? I've done the job on Meta-wiki quite successfully since July 2007 - before we made every admin a bcrat, I was by far the most active one. While of course I have my feelings about certain attitudes, I would respect community consensus. One of my better traits is a good eye for consensus - a very recent example, is here. I personally believe AE would not make a good bcrat at all, for various reasons, but I would respect the thoughts of the community. I'm not inactive here (I edit here every day, and watch recent changes regularly). I might not be active in article building as some, but I do work on articles occasionally. Not that it has anything to do with bureaucratship of course, and I "have" the experience already. Some may also have found themselves inadvertantly at the end of a "prickly" discussion with me. I try not to hold grudges, I hope you can try too. This is not something I want to add to my trophy cupboard, it's because Simple really could do with another bcrat.
So please, I'm hoping you'll give me a second chance and be the extra bcrat this wiki needs. What do you say? 02:48, 28 January 2009 (UTC)
Thanks for the offer, RF, but I'll probably leave it for now. 04:47, 28 January 2009 (UTC)
Enough talk, not enough action. I propose every administrator is made a bureaucrat retrospectively and in future. Passing an RFB is not a badge to aim to and this community is small. So why not roll both lots of buttons into one community !vote? () 14:49, 28 January 2009 (UTC)

I would like to suggest that if there are any administrators who are not trusted enough to pass an RFB (a couple of extra buttons), they probably shouldn't be administrators. Admins need to know consensus when they close RFDs, so surely they should have the ability to do the same in RFAs? () 15:00, 28 January 2009 (UTC)
Hello all,
it very much looks like we need more bureaucrats; Chenzw is currently running. While I do not want to influence his chance of success, I nevertheless want to state the following:
This is not a democracy, so I will expect the following, from every active admin (and any named user who wants to participate):
In addition to this, we will need another Checkuser. This will be difficult:
In a week's time we can then nominate the most likely candidates for cratship/cu, in the hope of replenishing the ranks.
I very much regret it has come to this -- () 16:26, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
I would support Chenzw, Synergy, Majorly, and Kennedy for bureaucrat at this time. I would support Djsasso, Malinaccier, Synergy, Kennedy, RyanCross, or Chenzw for CheckUser. I myself am over 18, however, I cannot be a CU because I am not currently an administrator. Cheers, 16:42, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
Checkuser is a huge deal. Majorly, with his vast experience across the Wikisphere, knows the privacy policy inside out. I would back him to only run checkuser when needed and I would urge others, if Majorly would offer himself, to put aside any issues they may have with him in favour of choosing somebody who would follow the privacy policy - that's all that matters () 16:47, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
As a note to other users here, I have decided to nominate Majorly for Check User at this time because he is the only one, I feel, with the experience necessary for this task at this time. Cheers, 16:58, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
Hi there all. I have noticed an increase in the amount of vandalism that has been occuring on this site ever since that note about flagged revisions has hit the news worldwide. I was expecting something along these lines, however, I believe that the amount of vandalism on this site has increased substantially since the amount we've been getting for the past couple of weeks. I just wanted to warn everyone on this site to keep on your toes, as we seem to be a magnet for vandalism lately. Cheers, 21:47, 28 January 2009 (UTC)
The has not updated the since the 25th at about 18:00 Eastern time, what's up?--  07:48, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
I'd like to propose a ban of this editor. Just lately, he has become increasingly disruptive on this project, posting absurd comments such as questions about his death, whiny comments about not getting a Christmas greeting, calling another user a "dope" because they called Kosovo a country (admin only), claiming he looks like a "dick" because he is last on a friends list, claiming he looks like an "absolute fucking shitty dick" (in big), again because he is last on a friends list. These are just some of his immature comments. There's also this, which is highly hypocritical, considering he called users "dope" and "troll". He has had something like 5 RFAs, all of which were obvious fails. I'm thinking he is becoming a net negative to Simple. 21:24, 30 January 2009 (UTC)
I will a year long ban at least, maybe longer. 22:06, 30 January 2009 (UTC)
"(reset)" I think I was the first to suggest this ban, so i'll clarify what I had in mind. A ban on all Wikipedia: Wikipedia talk: User: User talk: (Except his own) space pages "unless" it is constructive edits such as reporting vandalism, vandal warning etc. At this stage a full ban or block would be punitive and would not achieve anything. If the user breaks the "terms" of the ban, then we can look at blocking for short periods of time. If the user is "reformed" or w/e then the ban can be lifted, I suggest 3 months-1 year before a review is made. Thoughts? 23:10, 30 January 2009 (UTC)
I would a project-space ban and a mentorship with an admin (such as Synergy or Kennedy). 03:06, 31 January 2009 (UTC)
I will be working on a ban/mentoring plan in my userspace. When it is finished, I shall post the link here. 13:21, 31 January 2009 (UTC)
I Shap's plan. Especially that last note at the bottom about learning policies.   16:49, 31 January 2009 (UTC) See my comment(s) below.   16:22, 1 February 2009 (UTC)
Comment Why aren't other regular editors such as myself noted in the possibility of a mentorship? I am quite knowledgable about the policies and I wouldn't mind doing the mentorship as well. Cheers, 20:48, 31 January 2009 (UTC)
Propose project ban Clearly having a net negative effect on the project () 16:30, 1 February 2009 (UTC)
I move to close this with the result of ban tharnton for one year during this time he can learn policies and hopefully mature.   00:11, 3 February 2009 (UTC)
Here on Simple English Wikipedia, I see admins calling Vandals 'idiots'. This is not very nice. So why is this? 08:37, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
Hi there all. I was wondering if it would be at all possible for us to be able to get new page patrolling on the Simple English Wikipedia (the kind that the English Wikipedia has). Would this be at all possible? Cheers, 17:07, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
I have copied a proposed guideline from en that I think would be useful here, it called, "". Please check it out and share your opinion on what should become of it on . Thank you!--  20:09, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
On blocking/banning templates that do not have a place on their own and the template, I see people using 'editing' instead of 'changing'. Why is this? 17:10, 30 January 2009 (UTC)
Just to throw this one into the open. This project is meant to be for Simple English. Before I begin drafting one, would I be wasting my time if I suggested ALL pages on this project are in Simple English, namely not just the articles? () 03:01, 31 January 2009 (UTC)
I've been a member since mid-December, and I have a page in my user space that I'd like to take live. I can't seem to find the move button I keep reading about. Has the policy changed? Do I need to have been a member for more than 4 days now?

Reza Shāh Pahlavi

Reza Shāh Pahlavi, also Pahlevi (b. Reza Khān; March 16, 1878 – July 26, 1944) was the Shāh of Iran from 1925 to 1941, when he abdicated (declared that was no longer king) and passed the position on to his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In 1921, he and Seyed Ziya-al-Din Tabatabaei launched a coup d'état overthrowing the Qajar Dynasty. Reza Shāh then became minister of war, and eventually became king, which started the Pahlavi dynasty. Because of his friendship with Adolf Hitler, the British suspected that Nazi Germany was conspiring with Iran and ordered Reza Shāh to abdicate, which he then did.
Reza Shāh was originally Reza Khān, a military officer of the Persian Cossack Brigade who could not read, and taught himself.

Armageddon (2008)

Armageddon (2008) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event made by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which took place on December 14, 2008 at the HSBC Arena in Buffalo, New York. Seven matches took place at the event.
The main rivalry on the Raw brand was between John Cena and Chris Jericho, with the two fighting over the World Heavyweight Championship. At Survivor Series, Cena returned to the WWE after a neck injury and defeated Jericho to win the championship. On the November 24 episode of "Raw", Jericho defeated Randy Orton and Batista (David Bautista) in a Triple Threat match to earn a championship match against Cena at Armageddon.
The main rivalry on the SmackDown brand was between Edge, Triple H and Jeff Hardy over the WWE Championship. At Survivor Series, Edge returned to the WWE after a three-month absence after being announced as a replacement for Hardy, who was originally scheduled to face the defending champion Triple H and Vladimir Kozlov (Oleg Prudius) in a Triple Threat match for the championship, but was found unconscious in his hotel and did not compete in the match. Edge pinned Triple H and won the championship. On the November 29 edition of "SmackDown", General Manager Vickie Guerrero announced a "Beat the Clock Sprint" tournament, where the one of the three competitors (Triple H, Hardy, and Kozlov) would face Edge at Armageddon for the WWE Championship. Both Triple H and Hardy beat their opponents at twelves minute and thirteen seconds (12:13). The next week, Vickie Guerrero announced that WWE board members had decided Edge would have to defend the title against both Triple H and Jeff Hardy.
ECW's main rivalry was between ECW Champion Matt Hardy and Vladimir Kozlov. After Hardy had stopped Kozlov from being able to beat his brother's time in the "Beat the Clock Sprint", Kozlov would gain revenge in the following weeks on "SmackDown" and "ECW" by assaulting Hardy, finally challenging him to a match, in which Hardy accepted.
Another match that took place at Armageddon was the finals of a 8-man tournament for a WWE Intercontinental Championship title shot against the current champion, William Regal. On the November 11th Edition of "Raw" Stephanie McMahon ordered a tournament to determine who would be the next person to receive a shot at the title. The first round saw four standard matches: Kofi Kingston (Kofi Mensah) advance over Kane, due to Kane getting disqualified. CM Punk defeated Snitsky (Gene Snitsky) by pinning him following a GTS (Go To Sleep). John Morrison (John Hennigan) defeated Finlay (Dave Finlay) following a pin after an Enzuigiri. The final match of the opening round saw Rey Mysterio defeat The Miz (Mike Mizanin). The second round was started by Punk defeating John Morrison with the GTS, and Mysterio defeated Kingston by pinning him with an Oklahoma roll. As a result, CM Punk would wrestle Rey Mysterio in the finals of the tournament.

Samak Sundaravej (13 June 1935 - 24 November 2009) was the 25th Prime Minister of Thailand, Minister of Defence and also the leader of People’s Power Party. He was named by the mass media as "Uncle Mak" or "Mr. Rose Apple Nose" because of the shape of his nose. He was forced to resign as prime minister because he was also acting as chef on a TV show. The constitutional court in Thailand said he could not have two jobs.
Sundaravej was the son of Samian Sundaravej and Amphan Jitrakorn. He was born in Bangkok in 1935. He married Lady Surat Sundaravej and they had twins called Kandapha and Kanjanakorn. After finishing university, he began writing articles about politics for ‘Siam government’ and ‘Bangkokian’. 
He started in politics as a member of "Democrat Party" in 1968. He became well–known in 1976 from radio managing which has the information that attack education organization in that age. He also encouraged the people to loathe the education organization. He was the one who gave the command to move the student resistant gang on 16th October 1976.
At the end of that, he became the Minister of Interior, as well as resigning from the Democrat Party. In 1979, he set up the new party and became the leader of ‘Thai Population Party’.
He was elected to be a Bangkok governor in 2000 with 1,016,096 votes, which was more votes than ever before. The person who came second was Sudarat Keyuraphan (the member from the Thais Love Thailand Party).
Sundaravej took a position of a governor during 2000-2004. But after he passed the office, he’d been suspected to relate with the lawsuit about buying fire engines until now. He decided not to apply for a governor, but applied to be a senator instead. 
Until 29th January 2008, the House of Representatives had a resolution to appoint Samak to be Prime Minister. He was agreed to be a Minister of Defence. He was suspected to be Taksin (23rd Prime Minister; the one who was fleeing imprison punishment to foreign country)’s nominee. 
On 12th September 2008, Samak resigned from being the leader of the ‘People’s Power Party’ with the reason that he had done his duty, so he wanted to end his political role and let the members decide what to do next.
Sundaravej died at the age of 74 in Bangkok. He died because of liver cancer, which he had been fighting for one year.

OK, so I strongly believe that Tharnton and Teenly are the same person. For one, they are both around the same age. Two, Teenly on SWT opposed Tharnton's ban because he was 9 and grownups make mistakes too while thoroughly sounding like Tharnton posting. In addition, Teenly came here knowing how to edit etc and jumped right into the swing of things which makes me suspect socking more.   17:26, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

However, the former county seats of the different districts were kept as outpost. Those are namely Glauchau, Limbach-Oberfrohna, Werdau and Hohenstein-Ernstthal.
In July 2008, there were 25,026 people jobless. That means there was a rate of unemployment of 11.1 percent. It was the lowest jobless rate of the Regierungsbezirk Chemnitz. Because of the end of the schoolyear the unemployment rate of pupils rose up.
In the rural district Zwickau is one Study Academy (called: Berufsakademie Glauchau) nine vocational schools and some grammar schools. Overall there are 124 schools. In Chemnitz and Zwickau are different Universities.

Carnival of the Animals

The Carnival of the Animals (French: "Le Carnaval des Animaux") is a musical composition by Camille Saint-Saëns. It is one of the best known pieces of classical music for children. 
Saint-Saëns wrote the "Carnival of the Animals" as a directioner while composing his "Symphony No. 3". "Carnival" was performed at a small gathering of friends. Saint-Saëns did not want the general public to hear it, because he did not want to be thought of as someone who wrote jokey pieces. He wanted to be thought of as a serious composer. Just one movement was published during his lifetime: the famous Swan movement for solo cello. The rest of the work was not performed until a year after Saint-Saëns’ death. In his life, he also dreamed of percabeth.b
There are 14 short movements, with a short introduction. Saint-Saëns arranged it for an orchestra consisting of flute doubling piccolo, clarinet (B flat and C), two pianos, glass harmonica, xylophone, two violins, viola, cello and double bass. Today it is often performed with a full orchestra of strings, and with a glockenspiel instead of a glass harmonica, which is an unusual instrument.
After an introduction the pianos introduce a march theme. They imitate the roar of the lions. 
This music sounds like hens clucking (the strings) and a male rooster crowing (the clarinet).
The two pianos seem to go wild with scales rushing up and down madly.
This movement for strings and piano is very slow, like a tortoise. Saint-Saëns makes a musical joke here: the tune is the same tune as the famous 'Can-Can' from Offenbach's operetta "Orpheus in the Underworld", but played very slowly.
This double bass solo with piano accompaniment makes the elephant sound heavy and clumsy. In the middle section the elephant tries to dance a waltz. This is also a musical joke - the tune is taken from Felix Mendelssohn's "Incidental Music to A Midsummer Night's Dream" and Hector Berlioz's "Dance of the Sylphs" where it is played on high-sounding instruments.
The two pianos hop about gracefully like kangaroos.
This is very graceful music with the tune played on the flute, accompanied by strings, with occasional glissandi (slides) on the glass harmonica.
The “Persons with Long Ears” are actually donkeys. It is played on two violins which imitate the “hee-haw” sound of the donkey.. 
The pianos play gentle chords, like someone walking quietly through a forest. Now and again the clarinet plays two notes which sound like the call of the cuckoo.
The flute has a very delicate, fast tune accompanied by strings and pianos. It sounds like birds flying in an aviary (bird cage). 
This is another joke, because “pianists” are people who play the piano, they are not animals. Saint-Saëns makes them seem rather stupid as they practise their scales.
The xylophone plays a fast tune which sounds like skeletons playing. Saint-Saëns is making a joke about himself, because he uses a tune from one of his own works: the "Danse Macabre". There are bits of other tunes as well: "Ah! vous dirai-je, Maman" (known in the English-speaking world as "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"), the French nursery rhymes "Au Clair de la Lune" and "J'ai du bon tabac", the popular anthem "Partant pour la Syrie" as well as the aria "Una Voce Poco Fa" from Rossini's "Barber of Seville". Saint-Saëns was saying that these tunes were old-fashioned (like fossils).
This is one of the most famous of all tunes for the cello. It is a lovely tune which sounds like a swan swimming gracefully along. 
All the instruments join in the Finale which has bits from nearly all the movements.

Tropical Storm Arthur (2002)

Tropical Storm Arthur was the first tropical storm of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season. Arthur reached its highest winds of 60 miles per hour on July 16. Arthur started on July 14 near North Carolina, Tropical Storm Arthur moved mostly northwest and Tropical Storm Arthur died on July 16. The remains caused bad weather in Newfoundland and killed one person.
On July 9 a low-level circulation started. It moved very slowly northwest and did not become a tropical depression. The low-level circulation moved ashore in Florida. Early on July 14 the low entered the Atlantic Ocean. Clouds around the low started growing. Late on July 14 the low became Tropical Depression One, while it was 45 miles south of Hatteras, North Carolina. On the morning of July 15 it became a tropical storm and was called "Arthur". Arthur slowly got stronger until July 16 when it reached its highest winds, which were at 60 miles per hour. Wind shear caused Arthur to die shortly later. The extratropical low was last seen on July 19 while it was near Greenland. 
Because the damage was low the name "Arthur" was not retired. This caused the name "Arthur" to be used again in 2008, it also did not get retired. So the name "Arthur" is going to be used again in 2012.

Eurasian lynx

The Eurasian lynx "(Lynx lynx)" is a medium-sized cat native to Europe (Including Finland, Sweden, Norway) and Asia. It is one of the largest predators in Europe and Asia. It is the largest of the lynxes with a length of 80130 cm.
Lynx prey mostly on small to fairly large sized mammals and birds. Among prey for the species are hares, rabbits, marmots, squirrels, dormice, other rodents, grouse, red foxes, wild boar, foxes, chamois, moose, roe deer, red deer, reindeer and other ungulates. 
Although taking on larger prey presents a risk to the animal, the bounty provided by killing them can outweigh the risks. The Eurasian lynx thus prefers fairly large ungulate prey, especially during winter when small prey is less abundant. They are the only "Lynx" species in which ungulates provide more of their diet than lagomorphs or rodents. Where common, roe deer are the preferred prey species for the lynx. Even where roe deer are quite uncommon, as in Sweden, the deer are still the favored prey species, though in summer smaller prey and occasional domestic sheep are eaten. In parts of Finland, introduced White-tailed deer are eaten mostly regularly. In some areas of Poland and Austria, red deer are the preferred prey and, in Switzerland, chamois are taken. They will also feed on carrion when it is available. Adult lynx require of meat per day, and may take several days to fully consume some of their larger prey.
Found in the Chinese provinces and Northern Pakistan.

Hassocks

Hassocks is a large village in West Sussex, England. 
It can be found about north of Brighton, and nearly 7000 people live there. Hassocks has grown since the 19th century, when work started on the London to Brighton railway. 
The village became better known after 2 April 1839 when the first railway line was laid between London and Brighton. Over 6,000 workmen were hired for up to two years building, blasting and clearing rubble beneath the South Downs to create Clayton Tunnel. It is the second longest tunnel on the London to Brighton Line, some 1¼ miles long and below ground. The opening of Hassocks Gate as the railway station in 1841 saw the beginning of the village that is known today. In 1861 there was a collision between two trains, which killed 23 people and injured 176 others.
Today Hassocks has lots of shops and a well-used community centre called Adastra Hall. It is quite expensive to buy a house in Hassocks, though it is not quite as expensive as neighbouring Ditchling and Hurstpierpoint. These villages have many nice, older buildings whereas Hassocks village centre was mainly built after World War Two.
Hassocks railway station serves the village. There are regular train services to London and Brighton. 
Hassocks Infant School is a maintained infant school for pupils aged 4 to 7. It currently caters for around 180 pupils. The school is centrally located in the village. 
After leaving the Infant School children in the main go onto Windmills School in Dale Avenue which caters for years 3–6. 
Secondary education for the village and surrounding areas is looked after by Downlands Community School. 
A new sports hall and AstroTurf football pitch have recently been constructed at Downlands Community School. 
There is a windmill being worked on by lots of local volunteers to try and get it back to working condition again as it was completely ruined. The windmill made flour for the first time in 100 years in October 2008.
Hassocks's twin towns are:

Daguerreotype

A Daguerreotype is a method of creating photographs that is no longer in general use. A man called Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre invented the daguerreotype process in France in 1839. 
The new type of photography became very popular very quickly as it was capable of capturing a "truthful likeness." By 1850, there were over seventy daguerreotype studios in New York alone.
However the popularity of the daguerreotype was short lived as other cheaper processes were invented. By the late 1850s faster and less expensive processes such as the ambrotype, became available. A drawback of the Daguerreotype was that there was no negative from which to produce lots of images. Each picture was therefore unique, the only way to get a copy was to rephotograph the image.

Dowry

A dowry (also known as trousseau or tocher) is the money, goods, or estate that is given to a woman at the time of her marriage. A dowry creates a fund for her support in case her husband dies. The dowry eventually goes to her sons and daughters of this marriage. At times a dowry was required to validate a marriage.
Dowry started as gifts that were handed out to the bride at the time of marriage to make her stay at in-laws place more comfortable. It has hence taken an ugly turn, many parts of India still have a high incidence of dowry demands. Some states with a very poor reputation with regards to dowry are - Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu. This is a sad reality in Indian marriages and has gone unchecked.

Oldland Mill

Oldland Mill is an 18th century windmill. It can be found in the village of Keymer, near Hassocks, West Sussex.
Oldland Mill was built somewhere around 1700, the earliest record of a windmill in the area dates from 1703. The mill was originally an open trestle mill, the roundhouse being added at a later date. Records show a mill stood in Keymer in 1755 and the mill was marked on a map dated 1783, but not shown on one dated 1795. The 1801 National Defence Schedule records the mill but the 1813 Ordnance Survey and Greenwood's 1829 map omit the mill. Records show that the mill was standing in 1828. Oldland Mill was working by wind until 1912. The mill began to fall into disrepair in the early part of the 20th century and continued to deteriorate.
The Sussex Archaeological Society acquired the mill in 1927 and repairs were carried out by E Hole and Sons of Burgess Hill in 1934. In 1976, at the Annual General Meeting of the Hassocks Amenity Association, there was a talk was given on the work of Weald and Downland Open Air Museum. The question of how to preserve Oldland Mill was raised. The mill was then in the ownership of the Sussex Archaeological Society. The mill was looked at in 1977 by millwrights Vincent Pargeter and Edwin Hole and found to be close to collapse. Following negotiations with the Sussex Archaeological Society in 1979 the Hassocks Amenity Association leased the mill in 1980 and began a period of volunteer led restoration.
The first working party on 2 August 1980 cleared rubbish around the mill and made a temporary repair to the roof of the roundhouse. In 1981, the two remaining sails and stock were removed. The mill was restored over the next ten years, with much of the framing being replaced, including the trestle, crown tree, breast, tail and side frames.Since then the mill has benefited from a grant and substantial work has been completed. The mill was stripped to her bare essentials and many new parts completely and accurately built from scratch to replace rotten parts. The whole mill has been reclad and the four sails have been lifted into position. The mill ground its first batch of corn for many decades in October 2008. Today the mill is looked after by The Oldland Mill Trust, a registered charity.

Golden Balls

Golden Balls is a British television game show which is normally broadcast at 15:30 to 16:30 on ITV and STV (Scottish Television). It is presented by Jasper Carrott and is filmed at the BBC Television Centre. After 25 February 2008, the show was sponsored by ITV Bingo (powered by Party Gaming).
At the back of the studio is the "Golden Bank", which is basically the same as lottery machines. Jasper starts the game by starting the ball machine, where 100 golden balls containing varied values from £10, to the £75,000 golden ball are. 12 of the golden balls are randomly drawn from the ball machine. But Amanda Grant, (The Balls Assistant), puts 4 "killers" into the bunch. This means that 16 golden balls, cash and killers, are shared equally between all 4 of the contestants who get 4 golden balls each. 2 for the front row and 2 for the back row. Once the contestant has been introduced, he/she shows Jasper and the other 3 contestants what they are. This is repeated with all the other 3 players. 
The back row is kept secret to their owner,(who has to say what they claim is there), until the players secretly vote for the weakest player, and the player with the most votes is voted off.
The 3 remaining contestants' balls are put back into the ball machine by Amanda. 2 new cash balls and 1 killer are added into the game. Each contestant still gets balls at random, but in round 2 it is 2 for the front row and 3 for the back. 
Again all the 3 contestants show their front balls to the other players. Then they say what they claim is on the back row. The contestants each vote for the weakest player off, and the player with the most votes is "binned". 
Again the golden balls that the contestants bring through to the final, are put back into the ball machine. Again Amanda puts 1 more killer into the game. There are 11 balls, that are placed onto a table with 5 golden slots for the balls to win, and a hole for the balls to bin. The 2 contestants take it in turns to pick a ball to bin, (which means it is out of the game), and pick a ball to win, (which goes into 1 of the 5 winning golden slots). 
If they get say the £75,000 ball, then the £9,500 ball into the winning slots and then get a killer, it will a zero off the accumalated total. Once they get the number of money in the jackpot total for the day and have all 5 balls into the golden 5 slots, the contestants have to negotiate "Split Or Steal". 
Both contestants have 2 balls in front of them. 1 of them has the word "Split" inside it and the other has the word "Steal" inside it. If 1 of the contestants decides to Split and the other Steals, the player who Steals goes home with all of the money and the player who Splits goes home with nothing. If both players Split, they both split the jackpot total. If both contestants steal, they both go home with nothing. 
Jasper asks the players to look inside both of the golden balls, to make sure they know which one is which. Once they know what they are, Jasper lets the players discuss what they are going to do for a short while. He then asks the players to pick 1 of the 2 balls in front of them. Jasper then counts down from 3, and the players reveal either their Split or their Steal ball.

1990 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1990 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1990, and lasted until November 30, 1990. However, storms can form outside these dates. For example, Tropical Depression One formed on May 25. This season was very active with two depressions, six tropical storms, seven hurricanes, and one major hurricane. At that time it was the most active hurricane season.
This season was less deadly and damaging than other seasons, with only 116 deaths, and $150 million. The few deaths and little bit of damage were due to the fact that most of the storms were relatively weak, and most of the storms stayed at sea.
These are the names that were set aside for 1990. The names that did not get used are marked in .
In the spring of 1991, Hurricane Diana and Klaus had their names replaced by Dolly and Kyle in 1996.

1992 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1992 Atlantic hurricane season started on June 1, 1992, and lasted until November 30, 1992. However, storms can form outside these dates. For example, Subtropical Storm One formed on April 21. 
This season did not have very many storms, with only 3 tropical depressions, 3 subtropical/tropical storms, and 4 hurricanes. One of the 4 hurricanes (Hurricane Andrew) become a major hurricane (category 3+).
This season was not very deadly, but it was very damaging. There was only 66 deaths, but there was $26 billion in damage, all of which caused by Hurricane Andrew. Hurricane Andrew was the most damaging hurricane in the history of the United States, until Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
Subtropical Storm One started on April 21, more than a month before June 1, the start of hurricane season. It lasted only 3 days, before wind shear caused it to die. It was one of only two storms ever to form in April. The other was Tropical Storm Ana in 2003.
Tropical Depression One was a short-lived tropical depression. It started on June 25 and died on June 26, not long after striking Florida. This tropical depression killed 5 people and caused $2.6 million in damage.
Tropical Depression Two started on July 24. A wind gust near 40 mph made it seem like it would become a tropical storm. But the National Hurricane Center did not call it a tropical storm because the pressure was at 1015, which is very high for a tropical storm. Two moved sharply northeast before it died two days later, on July 26.
Hurricane Andrew was the strongest hurricane of the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season. It started on August 16. Later it hit land twice in Florida and once in Louisiana. Andrew caused nearly $26 billion in damage. This made it, at the time, the costliest hurricane in the history of the United States.
Bonnie started on September 17. It moved mostly east across the Atlantic and passed into the Azores before it died. The hurricane caused no damage, but may have killed one person in the Azores. 
Hurricane Charley started on September 21 in the far eastern Atlantic Ocean. It became a category 2 hurricane and passed into the Azores. Charley died on September 27.
Danielle started on September 22. It soon became a tropical storm. Tropical Storm Danielle made landfall in the Delmarva Peninsula before it died on September 26. The storm killed two people. 
Tropical Depression Seven started on September 25 about halfway between Africa and South America. Seven lasted nearly a week before it died on October 1.
Earl started on September 26 as a depression. This depression headed for Florida and became a tropical storm. It reversed course before hitting land in Florida. Tropical Storm Earl died on October 3.
Frances started on October 23 as a tropical storm and quickly became a hurricane. It took a path far from land. Hurricane Frances died on October 27.

Hurricane Ismael

Hurricane Ismael was a weak hurricane that formed during the 1995 Pacific hurricane season. The storm formed on September 12, 1995. It became a hurricane on September 14, while it was located off the coast of Mexico. It moved to the north, and made landfall in Sinaloa. Ismael quickly weakened over land, and died out on September 16 over northwestern Mexico. 
In the ocean, the storm caused waves that were up to 30 feet (9 m) high. The hurricane wrecked 52 ships and killed 57 fishermen. On land, Ismael caused 59 deaths in Mexico. The hurricane destroyed thousands of houses, leaving 30,000 people without homes. The storm reached the United States where it caused heavy rainfall in parts of New Mexico. It was the deadliest hurricane in the 1995 season.
The storm that eventually became Hurricane Ismael started off the southern coast of Guatemala on September 9. As it grew, it moved to the west-northwest. After a few days with no activity, a low pressure area developed off the coast of Mexico. Late on September 12, it formed into Tropical Depression Ten. At this time, the storm was about south-southwest of Manzanillo, Colima. The depression moved to the northwest, and strengthened to a tropical storm early on September 13.
Because of the influence of a nearby weather system over Baja California, Ismael slowly turned to the north. Tropical Storm Ismael became stronger as it moved northward. Ismael continued to grow, and on September 14, it became a hurricane.
An eye began to form inside of the storm, and six hours after becoming a hurricane, it reached its peak strength. Ismael then sped up as it moved to the northwest. The storm passed just east of Cabo San Lucas on September 15. The hurricane made landfall in the state of Sinaloa on September 15. Ismael quickly lost strength over land, and it died out on September 16. The remains of Ismael continued moving to the north. Rain from the storm reached parts of the United States.
At first, weather forecasters expected the hurricane to stay over the ocean. However, when they later found out that the storm would affect land, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Manzanillo, Colima, to Cabo Corrientes. The warning was later extended to Los Mochis and another one was given out for part of the east coast of Baja California Sur. Forecasters then issued a hurricane warning from Mazatlán to Los Mochis. Before the storm arrived, 1,572 people moved to emergency shelters.
Hurricane Ismael caused waves that were 30 feet (9 m) high over the Gulf of California. Many fishermen were not prepared for the hurricane. Because of this, 52 boats were destroyed, of which 20 sank. About 57 fishermen died off the shore; some washed up on shore. Another 150 fishermen survived the storm by waiting on islands or . Navy rescue teams searched for days off the coast of Mexico to find victims and survivors.
The storm dropped moderate to heavy rainfall, which reached 7.76 inches (197 mm) in Sinaloa. The heavy rain caused flooding in four municipalities. In one area, the hurricane destroyed 373 houses and damaged 4,790 others. The storm left 177 houses without drinking water, and led to lots of power outages. Damage was very bad where the hurricane made landfall. In Los Mochis, the winds from Ismael knocked down houses and telephone poles. A total of 59 people were killed in Sinaloa.
Ismael produced heavy rainfall farther to the north. Very bad flooding was reported in Huatabampo. Across Sonora, the winds destroyed 4,728 houses and removed the roofs from 6,827 homes. The hurricane also ruined 107 schools. The hurricane damaged about 100 miles (165 km) of roads. About 83 sq. miles (215 km²) of crop lands were damaged.
Rain from what was left of Ismael reached southwestern Arizona and southern New Mexico in the United States. The storm also caused heavy rainfall near the border between New Mexico and Texas. The rainfall caused flooding on roads and in buildings. Several roads were damaged and closed. In Lubbock, Texas, the rainfall caused flash flooding, which forced many roads to be shut down. Moisture from the storm went as far east as the Mid-Atlantic States.
Because the damage from the storm was so bad, the name "Ismael" was retired. The name was replaced with "Israel", which was used for a storm during the 2001 Pacific hurricane season. After Hurricane Ismael passed, officials gave out 4,800 sheets, 500 cushions, and 1,500 blankets to people who were affected by the storm. Divers helped to recover sunken ships and drowned bodies. Workers quickly fixed the communication network. Other workers gave out aid to people in Sonora.

Atmospheric convection

Atmospheric convection is caused by one of two possibilities. One is instable state of atmosphere. The second is different ability of Earth's surface to get warmer. The first type (unstable state of atmosphere) can be called spontaneous. The second type (convection caused by unequal soaking) can be called contact convection. Spontaneous convection starts at any level. Contact convection starts near the terrain.
The most frequent is contact convection. The sun is shining on the surface. It gets warmer and warmer. This leads to vertical draft, that is spontaneous rising and downward motions. This warm air has higher temperature than its neighborhood. Warmer air has lower density than cold air. Warm air rises. Through this rising motion the air element decelerates because of friction. This trend stops when the temperature of this element is equal to the temperature of surrounding air. Next rising continues due to inertia
These thermal motions are used for example in gliding. The Thermal flow has enough energy to bring gliders to higher altitude.

A fullerene is any molecule composed entirely of carbon, in the form of a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, or tube. Spherical fullerenes are also called buckyballs, and they resemble the balls used in association football. Cylindrical ones are called carbon nanotubes or buckytubes. They are usually made in the form of a hollow ball or tube. The fullerene was found in 1985 by Robert Curl, Harold Kroto and Richard Smalley at the University of Sussex and Rice University, and was named after Buckminster Fuller because his famous Geodesic domes are similar in shape.
Fullerenes are made by the heating of graphite in an electric arc in the presence of inert gases such as helium or argon.

The Jesus and Mary Chain

The Jesus and Mary Chain are an alternative rock band formed in East Kilbride, Scotland in 1984. The band is based on the songs written by brothers Jim and William Reid and has had nineteen different musicians over the years. They have created many albums, singles and EPs. The band began playing in 1984 and stopped in 1999. In 2007 the band reunited and began work on a new album with Scarlett Johannson.
The Jesus and Mary Chain was based on the songwriting partnership of its two main members, Jim and William Reid, and bass guitar player Douglas Hart.
The bands first career song, "Upside Down", was sold in October 1984 by Creation Records. The melody and lyrics ("Inside I feel so bad/So low I feel so sad/Feels like I'm going mad/Best friend I've ever had.") are similar to 1960s 'wall of sound' pop music such as music by Brill Building and Phil Spector, but "Upside Down" is more noisy with very simple drums and one guitar playing high pitched feedback during most of the song.
The first drummer to play for the band was Murray Dalglish who was replaced by Bobby Gillespie (now a singer for Primal Scream). William Reid claimed that he had played the drums for the first song himself because of Dalglish's lack of ability. The single was given pleasing reviews by British music journalists, and the band was given fanatical support by the "NME", it was their live shows that started most interest in The Jesus and Mary Chain.

1988 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1988 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1988 and ended on November 30, 1988. However tropical cyclone can form outside these dates for example, Tropical Depression One formed on May 30. This season was active with 19 depressions. This season was damaging and it featured the strongest storm known at the time, Hurricane Gilbert.
This list is the name that were set aside for the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season. The name lists repeat every six year and the only way the names are changed is if a name is retired. This list is the same as the list in 1982 because no names were retired in 1982.
In the spring of 1989 Gilbert and Joan were replaced by Gorden and Joyce in 1994, however it 1994 Joyce was not used because of 1994's low activity.

Sidecarcross

Sidecar-Cross racing, also known as Sidecar Motocross, is a race that uses a different motorcycle chassis than regular motocross. It also uses a team of two people riding together, a "driver" and a "passenger".
Sidecarcross is done on the same race track as normal motocross, but the driver has to ride differently then when riding solo. The driver cannot lean over in the turns. To make sure the sidecar does not flip over, the passenger leans out of the sidecar when they are in the corners. The passenger does much more work than the driver because he moves his whole body around all the time. 
One of the most important things in sidecar racing is teamwork; the best teams race together for many years.

From mid Feb to mid Mar I will be away from the computer. My job requires me elsewhere for that time. Pending operations will be in my . I'll do my best to bring everything to a comfortable stopping point. Very best, () 18:34, 1 February 2009 (UTC)
I think we should adapt the "complex" Wikipedia's standardization for all articles with a template that indicates the classes and importances of all articles. We can then decide as a community if we want to have metadata also (displays "A *-class article from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") () 06:04, 1 February 2009 (UTC)
OK guys, I'm leaving, probably doesn't come as much of a surprise after my months of inactivity, but there's no way I can contribute here any more.
To be honest, I don't really see much of a future for SEWP. The only way it'll move on is if we get rid of those that thrive on drama. They aren't interested in the content, only in collecting banned lunatics so that we can "mentor" them, which never really seems to work. You're even going to mentor Tharnton345 - HE'S NINE. That's why he causes trouble and doesn't fit in, we're asking a nine year-old to work in a semi-professional fun-free environment, it's never going to work. There's no fundamental misunderstandings there, he's just too young. Even if he isn't nine, it's obvious that he's too young to work here.
Those that thrive on drama are not suited to the Wikipedia environment. Right now, all the emphasis seems to be on building crap that doesn't actually do much at all, or on censoring pictures of breasts in case small children are scarred for life. There is no emphasis on content here, just on pointless Wikiprojects, userboxes, bans and RfAs and fighting. - 13:05, 1 February 2009 (UTC)
I do not think it is fair if you say Tharnton345 causes trouble because he is nine. Lots of grownups cause trouble. I am eight but I do not cause trouble. I bet you never knew I am eight. 16:40, 1 February 2009 (UTC)
Serious problems require serious measures. As suggested above, editors banned from EN for "disruption," for lack of a better word, should now be banned from Simple, with immediate and retrospective effect. Agreed? () 16:45, 1 February 2009 (UTC)
Have users even been working on the whole point of Wikipedia, our articles? We have very few quality and content articles, and we have thousands of stubs. We need more users working on these stubs! I would do so myself, but I'm too busy, both, in real life and around the foundation projects. Other than the thousands of stubs out there, Simple English Wikipedia is a drama central. That is why my activity levels are decreasing—the drama on this project is too much sometimes. I eventually started contributing to English Wikiquote, and now I'm an administrator there. It's "much" more peaceful there, and the percentage of drama there is 0. I think can agree with me. ;) Anyway, "something" has to be done here, but what? — () 17:31, 1 February 2009 (UTC)
I would have to agree with RyanCross on this. We need to completely remove the drama from this Wikipedia. I will do my best to prevent the drama that I would add to this project through my RfAs. I will do my best to help keep SE:WP a drama free zone now and in the future. Cheers, 19:17, 1 February 2009 (UTC)
Hello all,
Certain editors left the project. This makes it necessary to re-elect new users into positions of CheckUser and Bureaucrat. It is clear that with new users in these positions, this Wikipedia is going to change. That way, certain people may feel less at ease than they did before. This Wikipedia is at a crossroads, decisions need to be taken. I would therefore like you to not overrate the fact that certain editors left. This also creates new opportunities, but this wikipedia will probably need about the next two weeks to get back to normal.
In the meantime, please note:
Editors who want to freak out, should do so below my post. :) 
All the best -- () 16:58, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

CORPPA law says that children under 13 cannot be editors unless Simple Wikipedia has written permission from their parents on file. Which Simple Wikipedia Administrator is in charge of the CORPPA agreements? I am going to assume the answer is none. That means that somebody needs to get hold of that contract or the under age account gets banned. As for the 11 yr old (if that is truly their age), if they get their parents permission, than there is no problem with them being an editor. Parents should be the mentors, not the teenage administrators on this site. The administrators on this site can give help, guidance, and advice, but when things get out of control, the parents need to be involved.
I have also left Simple Wikipedia to create a Wikipedia fork. I do not agree with the goals of this project, and in viewing my options and the capabilities of MediaWiki, that is the option that will best suit my family's needs.
Gwib complains that I only cared about the appropriateness of images, and I did not contribute to content. Why would I contribute to content to a project that is unwilling to work to meet my needs and is outright hostile to them by threatening bots? I never got past the starting line. I quit the race and went down my own path.
There is no leadership here to provide an overall plan. There should be an editorial oversight board. That board should represent the whole community by having on the board:
This editorial board should be in charge of setting policy and the direction of the Simple Wikipedia. By having a mixture of people the represents the mixture of users of Simple Wikipedia, it will help ensure that all people's needs are met that could benefit from Simple Wikipedia. Having the board larger than 7 people will make the board too large.
Sorry no.

Okay, in light of many problems here, I have decided to publish my thoughts on a variation on en.wikis ArbCom which I had been working on for a while. I did not look at ArbCom as a base, I created it from scratch (although I am aware they are both essentially the same idea). I would like your thoughts and comments, and possibly a vote on whether or not you would like to see it (or a variation) implemented on Simple.Wikipedia. Regards, 14:42, 2 February 2009 (UTC)
There are a couple of potential issues with this that first spring to mind:
Ultimately I think it's a bad idea. Far too formal and far too bureaucratic for what it's designed to do. The difference between this and arbcom, is that arbcom don't handle content disputes. They decide mostly on troublesome editors: when to ban, desysop, restrict. This is not within Simple's scope at the moment, and not I think what this page is trying to achieve. A much more formal mediation cabal/mediation committee with a small election would serve the purpose much better in my opinion. With the community growing smaller, the number of er, "suitable" candidates for this role is growing shorter. I think a process like this is premature, but that's my opinion.  () 15:05, 2 February 2009 (UTC)
I'm not sure whether I'd back this or not, it needs more meat on the bones, but one condition would be to have ArbCom-like requirements - all users self-identify to the Foundation and 18-or-older () 15:44, 2 February 2009 (UTC)
(<-) Hello all, I think this Wiki is too small for something like that:
An alternative to the proposal would be to elect a third bureaucrat, and have them constitute such an assembly; but honestly, atm I think this wikipedia is too small.-- () 18:30, 2 February 2009 (UTC)
This is the worst idea I've seen yet. Its not workable, at all. 19:53, 2 February 2009 (UTC)
Is it just me (and my raging headache/flu), or is it that many wikipedians are leaving this project. To date, several admins: i.e., Creol, Gwib, Cometstyles, Archer7, and Barliner have all left the project within the past 60 days. Some users are becoming pessimistic that is project is falling towards a downward spiral to collapse. Is this a recurring trend or does the simplewiki might have to bail. If so, can someone [please] tell me what is going on. -- 06:29, 3 February 2009 (UTC)
Recently, a flood of user accounts (that appear to be sock-puppet accounts) have been created. Most like 90% of them edit less than a dozen times before ceasing activity. However some of those edits have been unconstructive, borderline vandalism. While most of the borderline vandalism is under control thanks to Chris G Bot and a few other vandal patrollers, it does create spam and unnecessary used up space in the new changes page. If this keeps up, shouldn't we ban school class projects. I'm pretty sure this wiki has more important things to deal with than allowing class projects. -- 07:48, 3 February 2009 (UTC)
I have a wiki on Wikia. From an administrator's standpoint, I like all of my icons to be organized (i.e. VGA, protected, etc.). Considering there are still a small number of VGAs and GAs, I propose that there be a template (I will create it, of course) that will organize the small icons at the top-right corner. I will provide an example at of how it will work. 16:17, 3 February 2009 (UTC)
 has been adding fact tags to articles in a fairly disruptive manner - adding "please give a reliable source" for facts that simple cannot be disputed, such as populations of towns, the existence of towns, birth dates, and what Burger King sells (Burgers, whaddya know?) Taggings like this are just plain disruptive in my view. I won't go as far as saying "everyone knows who Harry Potter is", but it's fact that in so completely undisputable, it does not need a pointless tag. If this IP is so concerned that statements of what is essentially common knowledge are uncited, he or she should add the easy to find references and add them instead of littering the article with tags. It's just laziness. 17:03, 3 February 2009 (UTC)
There is a growing number of inactive administrators that have now outnumbered active administrators. Last time I checked there are 11 active admins, 7 semi-active admins, and 13 inactive admins. Usually an inactive administrators' rights are removed via request for deadminship after 6 months of inactivity or when no sysop functions are performed. However some users for example, like Barliner have their last edit listed olast December 22, when he actually stopped his activity on March 25, '08, which is by now almost 11 months his he left the project. I think we should remove their sysop rights, but reinstate them when they return and feel like editing full-time again. -- 12:23, 4 February 2009 (UTC)
Relax, everyone! Just because someone doesn't edit for 6 months does not mean that they won't ever edit this site again. Just be patient. I believe that we should wait the full 12 months to give the inactive administrators a chance to come back. Furthermore, believe it or not, but inactive administrators actually pose less of a security risk than active administrators because they aren't in the editing limelight. Therefore, I don't see any reason to have them lose their bits at this point in time. 00:56, 5 February 2009 (UTC)
Adminship should be used, not just kept. The admins tend to represent this site - a bunch of inactive people nobody's heard of is not a good impression. I would suggest after nine months missing the person is no longer interested in editing here, and we can desysop them. We should, however "not" be just resysopping them when they return, otherwise the whole exercise will be pointless. They should have to go through RFA again to show they are still trusted by the community. I don't trust an inactive person. 01:25, 5 February 2009 (UTC)
I saw . Action should be taken for simplifying articles. This would prevent another attempt to close the project. I checked for ease of reading . The average article needs an 8th to 9th grade reading level. Is there any on going effort to do this? -- () 06:00, 5 February 2009 (UTC)
Hi there all. As of right now, we currently have 3 open proposals for Good Articles that are currently open for comments, and we have several open GA votes currently. I would like to ask all of the active editors that want to to become a part of the GA and VGA processes here on the Simple English Wikipedia. Cheers, 15:35, 5 February 2009 (UTC)
Hello there,
following Chenzw's promotion to Bureaucrat yesterday (my time), we now have 2 active and a semi-active bureaucrats, and a new CheckUser. After the discussions a while back, I think it would be good to have a third active 'crat (Vector's activity levels change a lot). I do see the following people as possible candidates (please note: earlier naming does not mean preference, I simply have to put someone first): Majorly, Synergy, American Eagle, and Djsasso.
I ask the community to help me pick two of the four candidates, which should go through a regular election process. No, we will not elect anyone against their will). If both of the selected candidates get enough votes, we will of course both make them crats; Becoming a bureaucrat is about trust, mostly. I am also open to other nominations.
Open for ideas -- () 10:33, 5 February 2009 (UTC)
I have asked both Kennedy and American Eagle if they would allow me to nominate them at this point in time. Majorly can't run for another month due to the fact that he just had a successful RfCU, and sorry Djsasso, but you are too new of an administrator for me to nominate for 'crat currently. Therefore, I have decided to nominate both Kennedy and American Eagle at this point in time. Cheers, 15:05, 5 February 2009 (UTC)
Hi there all. An IP address has proposed the deletion of a section from the article Lysergic acid diethylamide. Please leave any comments that you might have on the proposal on . Cheers, 15:41, 5 February 2009 (UTC)
Although this was a while back, the SEWP (2) closure proposal on Meta (and the resulting WR thread) brought up a few points, the main one being: What is Simple English? How is Simple English different to English? What makes Simple English Wikipedia different from English Wikipedia? We need a clear, concise "definition" of Simple English Wikipedia to quote to prospective closure-badgers. A possible "press statement" for users that think SEWP is a bad idea? It wouldn't harm to have one. () 21:54, 5 February 2009 (UTC)
Now, I know this is going to be one heated battle, so I got out my battle helmet, so here we go. We seem to be a little hypocritical about our selves. We say which is all well and good but yet we also call our selves the "Wikipedia for people learning English and children", so with us not censoring stuff, like pictures only, it kind defeats the purpose that we're building this Wikipedia for. Yes the people learning English will continue to come back, I have no worry about that. But, on the other hand, the children could come across a page such as Ejaculation (more than likely by hitting the "" button) and their parents catch them and any parent like mine would block the site thus losing that viewer/reader. My point is, for this Wikipedia maybe we should have just a "smidge" of censoring for the little one so we don't start building this Wikipedia for nothing. Nothing drastic like deleting those pages, I'm just saying remove things like the man ejaculating" video. That way parents would let their kids on here, and it would be aloud in school (cause I know for sure that this site wouldn't be aloud in a Polk County Public school). So maybe we should change "We are not censored..." to "We are not censored within reason..." Okay, *puts helmet on head*, thoughts?--  07:25, 8 February 2009 (UTC)
WP:STICK, Scream? 22:41, 8 February 2009 (UTC)
Hello, it's me again. I was wondering, could we have a streamlined process like the English Wikipedia where each nomination has their own subpage? The French Wikipedia also has a good system where they combined GA and VGA nominations so people can vote for either, and it's all organized in its own subpage. 07:00, 6 February 2009 (UTC)
The home page states the following. SE articles should use the 1000 most common English words. But it does not give a list. Is there a list of the 1000 most common English words? Is there a list of the 850 Basic English words? If there are these lists, please add links to the home page. (David Spector from English Wikipedia, Feb. 7, 2009)
If there isn't one already, I propose that a Wikicup or a Wikicontest be created. Many other projects have this in effect, and I personally believe it would be helpful to the whole community. Questions? Responses? 21:22, 8 February 2009 (UTC)
Should we start a new ? Its purpose can be used for dispute resolutions, negotiating, and solving issues for user conduct (pretty much like ). -- 06:34, 9 February 2009 (UTC)

Jack Swagger

Jacob "Jake" Hager (born December 3, 1982) is an American professional wrestler, currently signed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and wrestling under the name Jack Swagger on the Raw brand. He trained in WWE's developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), where he was the first FCW Florida Heavyweight Champion.
Hager was recruited to the University of Oklahoma as a two-sport athlete, playing as a defensive tackle in football and a heavyweight wrestler. During his junior year, he met Jim Ross, who was then World Wrestling Entertainment's Head of Talent Relations, and Ross encouraged Hager to contact him after graduating. In 2006, as an All-American wrestler, he set the single season record for most pins at 30, and graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a Bachelor's Degree in Finance.
In 2006, Hager had a WWE tryout in Deep South Wrestling, and in September 2006, Hager made his in-ring debut for Deep South Wrestling defeating Antonio Mestre in a dark match. He competed mainly in dark matches, before being moved to Ohio Valley Wrestling in January 2007. He started for OVW, by defeating Atlas DaBone, and in the following months began a rivalry with K.C. James Hager began teaming with a multitude of opponents to feud with James and his tag team partner Cassidy James.
In August 2007, Hager went back to Florida Championship Wrestling, where he began a rivalry with TJ Wilson. On February 15, 2008, Hager defeated Ted DiBiase, Jr. in Tampa, Florida at the Florida State Fair to become the first-ever FCW Florida Heavyweight Champion. Earlier in the night, DiBiase and Hager were the final two men remaining in a 23-man battle royal to determine the two championship contenders.
On March 22, 2008, Hager went against the FCW Southern Heavyweight Champion Heath Miller, in New Port Richey, Florida, to determine the true Heavyweight Champion. Both titles were on the line and Hager defeated Miller to become the undisputed heavyweight champion in Florida Championship Wrestling.
His first loss came in the form of a "Raw" dark match, at the TV taping on August 18, 2008 when he lost to William Regal.
On September 9, 2008, Hager made his start on the ECW brand under the ring name Jack Swagger, winning a match against a local wrestler. He quickly made himself a villain when he did not let the referee hold up his arm after the win, and later started a rivalry with Tommy Dreamer by attacking him after Dreamer had saved Chase Stevens from Mike Knox. He later defeated Dreamer in a wrestling match and an "All American Challenge" competition. After weeks of fighting, the two ended their rivalry in an Extreme Rules match, which Swagger won to extend his undefeated streak. He then set his sights on Matt Hardy's ECW Championship, and was named the number one contender on the December 30, 2008 edition of "ECW". On the January 13, 2009 episode of "ECW", Swagger defeated Hardy to win the ECW Championship, which is his first title in WWE. His undefeated streak in singles matches ended on the February 3 episode of "ECW", when he lost to Finlay.
On the March 1 episode of "Raw", Swagger beat Santino Marella to wrestle in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania XXVI. At WrestleMania, Swagger won the Money in the Bank ladder match, winning a contract for any WWE world championship that he could use at any time over the next year. On the episode of "Raw" after WrestleMania, Swagger tried to cash in his Money in the Bank contract on John Cena, but changed his mind when he saw that Cena was not hurt enough for Swagger to beat. As the match had never started, Swagger kept the contract for use at a future date.
Swagger cashed in his Money in the Bank contract during the "SmackDown" taping on March 30, 2010, after the World Heavyweight Champion Chris Jericho had been speared by Edge. Swagger went on to defeat Jericho to win the World Heavyweight Championship for the first time. after his championship win, Swagger changed into a more serious Swagger which was different from his last persona, where he was known for doing pushups and beating his chest during his ring entrance. He defended his championship against Edge and Jericho in a triple threat match on the April 16 episode of "SmackDown", and against Randy Orton in an Extreme Rules match at the Extreme Rules pay-per-view. At Over the Limit, Swagger kept the title against The Big Show by disqualifying himself. At the Fatal 4-Way pay-per-view on June 20, he lost the championship to Rey Mysterio in a fatal four-way match, which also had CM Punk and The Big Show.

Pablo Casals

Pau Casals i Defilló ("Pablo Casals") (born El Vendrell, Catalonia, 29 December 1876; died San Juan, Puerto Rico, 22 October 1973) was a Spanish Catalan cellist. He is generally thought of as the greatest cellist of his time codice_1. He made the cello popular as a solo instrument and inspired many cellists codice_1 of the younger generation. In his later years he was also a conductor as well as a composer.
Casals made many codice_1 recordings of solo, chamber, and orchestral music. Perhaps his best known recordings are the ones he made between 1936 and 1939 of the "Cello Suites" by Bach. When the dictator General Franco started to rule Spain he felt very strongly about the political situation codice_1. When the democratic party was defeated in 1939 he said that he would never go back to Spain until democracy had been restored. He did not live long enough to see the end to Franco’s rule.
Casals' father was the organist at the local church. He gave Casals his first music lessons, teaching him piano, violin and organ. When Casals was eleven, he heard a group of travelling musicians playing music codice_1. One of the instruments was the cello. He had never heard one and he decided that was what he wanted to play. His mother took him to Barcelona, where he went to a music school: the "Escola Municipal de Música". There he studied the cello, music theory and piano.
One day, when he was 13, he was looking at some old music in a second-hand music shop. He found some very old music for solo cello. They were the "Cello Suites" by Bach. People in those days thought they were just a collection of studies to help cellists with their technique, but Casals, although only still a boy, realized it was great music. He spent the next 12 years practising them until he felt ready to perform them. Casals’ discovery of these wonderful Cello Suites was the most important Bach discovery since 1829 when Mendelssohn found and performed the St Matthew Passion which the world had forgotten about.
Casals showed enormous talent for the cello codice_1. On 23 February 1891, when he was 14 years old, he gave a solo recital in Barcelona. He graduated from the "Escola" with honours two years later.
In 1893, the Spanish composer Isaac Albéniz heard him playing in a trio in a café codice_1. He gave him a letter which allowed him to be introduced to the Queen. She gave him money so that he could study at the Conservatory in Madrid. She then allowed him to go to Brussels to study at the Conservatory which was then the best in Europe for string instruments. The cello teacher mentioned a long list of cello pieces and asked him which ones he played. When Casals told him he could play them all, the teacher made fun of him. When Casals started playing, everyone was amazed at his talent. The teacher wanted him to be one of his pupils, but Casals had been insulted and so he went to Paris the next day. The Queen of Spain was angry with Casals when she heard what had happened and stopped sending him money codice_1.
In Paris he had very little money. He earned a living by playing second cello in the theatre orchestra of the "Folies Marigny". His mother tried to earn some money by sewing. In 1896, he returned to Catalonia where he taught at a music school and played principal cellist in the orchestra of Barcelona's opera house, the Liceu. In 1897 he appeared as soloist with the Madrid Symphony Orchestra, and was awarded the Order of Charles III from the Queen.
In 1899, Casals played the Saint-Saëns Cello Concerto at Crystal Palace in London, and later for Queen Victoria at her summer home at Cowes, Isle of Wight. He was becoming very famous. In Paris he make a great impression on everyone, especially the conductor Charles Lamoureux who had started a famous orchestra. Casals went to the Netherlands, the United States where he gave 80 concerts, and South America. He often played with the pianist Harold Bauer.
On 15 January 1904 Casals was invited to play at the White House for President Theodore Roosevelt codice_1. He played in the Carnegie Hall in New York, playing "Richard Strauss's Don Quixote" with the composer conducting. Between 1906 and 1912 he had a relationship with a Portuguese cellist Guilhermina Suggia, although they were never married.
In 1914 Casals married the American singer Susan Metcalfe. They were separated in 1928, but did not divorce until 1957.
Casals formed a trio with the pianist Alfred Cortot and the violinist Jacques Thibaud. They gave many concerts and made some of the first recordings of piano trio music. They played together for 30 years.
In 1905 he toured Russia. It was an unfortunate time because the Russian Revolution was taking place. During the concert he played in Moscow gunfire could be heard outside the hall. 
During the First World War Casals lived in New York. In 1919 he went back to Barcelona. He wanted to improve the music in his own country. There were very few people who could play well, so he founded his own orchestra: the Orquesta Pau Casals. This annual music festival continued until the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936.
Casals supported the Spanish Republican government. When it was defeated he said that he would not return until Spain was once more a democratic country. He then left his country and went into exile. He went to live in the French village of Prades which was near the border with Spain. He continued his career as a cellist. After World War II, in June 1946, he went to England and played the cello concertos by Schumann and Elgar at the Royal Albert Hall with Sir Adrian Boult conducting. Outside the hall the police had to help him get to his car because so many people were crowding round him.
Casals played in many countries, but refused to play in any country that was friendly with Franco’s government in Spain codice_1. In 1945 he gave a broadcast at the BBC and spoke to his people in Catalonia codice_1. He finished by playing a Catalan folksong called "El Cant dels Ocells" ("The Song of the Birds"). He played it at the end of all his concerts. When Britain recognized Franco’s government, Casals decided he could no long play in England. He made one big exception to his decision not to visit Franco-friendly countries: in 1961 he took part in a concert of chamber music in the White House on 13 November where he played to President John F Kennedy whom he admired.
In 1950 he continued his career as conductor and cellist at the Prades Festival in Conflent. He agreed to play on condition that the money that was made at the festival would be given to a refugee hospital nearby. Franco said that Spaniards were forbidden to go to the festival, but many managed to cross the border on foot. Many world-famous musicians played at Prades: Josef Szigeti, Isaac Stern, Rudolf Serkin and Eugene Istomin and others.
He continued to lead the Prades Festivals until 1966. 
When he was 80 Casals married one of his young students, a girl called Marta. They had met in Prades. Marta was from Puerto Rico where Casals’ mother had come from. They went to live in Puerto Rico in a house called "El Pesebre". In 1957 a musical festival was started there in the town of San Juan. He continued to visit the festival at Prades every year until 1966. He also gave masterclasses at American schools and universities as well as in other countries. Some of these were televised.
Casals was also a composer. One of his last compositions was the "Himne a les Nacions Unides" (Hymn of the United Nations); he conducted its first performance in a special concert at the United Nations on 24 October 1971, 2 months before his 95th birthday. 
Casals wrote an autobiography "Joys and Sorrows; Reflections" (1970).
Casals died in 1973 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, at the age of 96. In 1979 his remains were taken to El Vendrell, Catalonia, where he had been born. He did not live to see the end of the Franco dictatorial regime. Later, when Franco had died and Spain was a democracy once more, the Spanish government under King Juan Carlos I, issued a postage stamp in honour of the centenary of his birth. 
In 1989, sixteen years after his death, Casals was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.
No other cellist had such an influence on cello playing in the 20th century codice_1. He changed the way people thought about cello technique. For example: when he was young violinists and cellists were taught to practise with a book under the right arm. This made the bowing arm very stiff. Casals taught his pupils to play with a free bowing arm. Casals was a great teacher, and he learned a lot about playing through his teaching. He thought about fingering and bowing, and showed his pupils how their left hand could be strong but also relaxed.
The International Pau Casals Cello Competition is held in Germany once every four years. It was started in 2000 to help young cellists to start their careers. It is supported by the Pau Casals Foundation, under the patronage Casals’ widow. One of the prizes is the use of a beautiful cello which was owned by Casals.

National Football Conference

The National Football Conference (NFC) is one of the two conferences of the National Football League (NFL), the other being the American Football Conference. Every year, the winner of the NFC Championship Game receives the George Halas Trophy and gets to play against the winner of the AFC Championship Game in the Super Bowl.
Each NFC team plays the other teams in their division twice in the regular season. They play the team once at home and once at the other team's stadium (an "away" game). Each team also plays 10 other games given to their schedule by the NFL in the April before. Two of these games are assigned on the basis of the teams' final record from the year before. The other 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions. This assignment shifts each year. For example, in the 2007 regular season, each team in the NFC West played one game against each team in both the AFC North and the NFC South. In this way division competition is the same opponents except for the 2 games given based on the strength of the each team's season record from the year before.
At the end of each season, a series of playoff games are played among the top six teams in the NFC. These are the four division champions (by place standing) and the two other teams ("wild cards") with the best win-loss records. The NFC playoffs culminate in the NFC Championship Game for the George Halas Trophy. The NFC Champion plays the AFC Champion in the Super Bowl.
The NFC was made after the NFL merged with the American Football League (AFL) in 1970. While all of the former AFL teams along with the NFL's Cleveland Browns, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Baltimore Colts made up the American Football Conference (AFC), the other 13 NFL teams formed the NFC.
However, team owners could not agree to a plan on how to put the teams into divisions in the NFC. The proposals were narrowed down to five finalists. Then the plan that was selected was picked out of a glass bowl by then-NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle's secretary.
Since the merger, three expansion teams have joined the NFC. This makes the current total number of teams 16. When the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers joined the league in 1976, they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC, respectively, for one season before they switched conferences. The Seahawks returned to the NFC as a result of the 2002 realignment. The Carolina Panthers joined the NFC in 1995.

Dalmatian (dog)

The Dalmatian (Croatian: "Dalmatinac") is a breed of dog. It is named after the Adriatic coast of Dalmatia, in Croatia, its first home. The origins of the breed are unknown. The Dalmatian has been used for a war dog, fire department mascot, and shepherd. It is best known, however, as a coach or carriage dog, being a guard for horse-pulled vehicles. Also, the Dalmatian was used for being a circus performer, vermin hunter, fire-apparatus follower, bird dog, hound dog, and as a guard dog.
There are lots of arguments about the origin of this dog. Spotted dogs are known very much in the history of Africa, Europe, and Asia. Spotted dogs are also thought to have lived in Egypt. In 1700, a dog known as the "Bengal pointer", which looked a bit like the Dalmatian, was popular in England. Some think the Dalmatian is from Croatia, and is a Croatian breed. In the Middle Ages, it was used as a hound dog for hunting. The breed became popular as a carriage dog in the 1800s. They walked among the horses and carriages, following their masters, and guarding the carriages and horses while the master was busy with other things.
The Dalmatian is a medium , strong dog. Its skull is flat on the top. The muzzle is almost the same length as the top of the skull. Its nose can be either black, brown (liver), blue, or a dark gray that looks like black. Its round eyes are either brown or blue, or sometimes both put together.
Its toenails are white or black in dogs with a black spotted coat and brown or white in those with liver colored spots. Puppies are usually born completely white and the spots develop a few weeks after they are born.
The Dalmatian stands .
Around 8% of Dalmatians are born deaf and some can become partially deaf after a while making them expensive to treat.
Dalmatians are known as the "clowns" in the dog world. They are also loyal to their owners and caretakers. Dalmatians are medium sized dogs, and they are very active and lively. They are brave and smart, and their senses are very bright. This makes them a good choice to become a companion dog.

Araucaria heterophylla

Araucaria heterophylla, also called the Norfolk Island Pine, is a conifer tree.
The tree comes from Norfolk Island, a small island in the South Pacific. It is part of the family of trees called Araucaria, which are found in South Pacific, mainly on the island of New Caledonia. It is a very old family of trees. It is listed a vulnerable tree, which means that it is in danger of dying out unless efforts are made to save it.
Captain James Cook was the first Europen to see the trees. He thought they would make good masts for ships. The British government sent people to live on Norfolk Island in 1788 to make sure that these trees would be kept for use by the Royal Navy.

A vulnerable species is a species of animals or plants which are likely to become endangered unless something changes. Something has to be done to remove the things that are harmful to their survival, and their rate of reproduction needs to increase. 
A vulnerable species is one which has been categorised by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. There are now 4728 animals and 4914 plants listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.

Extinct in the Wild

Extinct in the Wild (EW) is a conservation status given to a species, a group of plants or animals, when the only known living members are being kept in captivity (kept in a zoo, or planted in pots), or they are no longer living in their normal habitat. 
Examples of such animals include:
Reintroduction is the release of species back into the wild. They come from captivity or moved from other areas where the species survives. It usually involves species that are endangered or extinct in the wild.
It is very hard to reintroduce EW species into the wild, even if their natural habitats were fixed. The main reason may be that the survival skills, which are passed from parents to offspring during parenting, are lost. In other words, the genetics of the species is saved, but the natural skills of the species is lost.

The Roscoe Wind Farm in Roscoe, Texas, is the world's largest wind farm (as of October 2009) with 627 wind turbines and a total installed capacity of 781.5 MW, which surpasses the nearby 735.5 MW Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center. The project cost more than $1 billion and provides enough power for more than 250,000 average Texan homes. It is located about 200 miles (320 kilometers) west of Fort Worth. The wind farm area spans parts of four Texas counties and covers nearly 100,000 acres, several times the size of Manhattan.
Unlike fossil-fueled power plants, wind farms require no water and generate no carbon dioxide -- a heat-trapping greenhouse gas that is a major contributory component for global warming.

Overweight

Overweight is the condition of a person when they have more fat in their body than what is thought as to be normal for their height.
To find out if a person is overweight, you can calculate their body mass index. People with a BMI of 25 or more are said to be overweight. Anything above 30 is said to be obese (very overweight). Overweight used to be a BMI of 27 or more. In 1998 this changed.
Being overweight is associated with health problems such as Type 2 diabetes. Obesity is associated with greater health problems than overweight. In 2006 Adams et al. estimated that the risk of death increases by 20 to 40 percent among overweight people. Some people think that being overweight is not as unhealthy as is commonly thought. A 2013 review of 97 Pubmed articles with a sample size of 2.88 million found that overweight is associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality (death) than 'normal' weight. Body fat contains energy that the body can use to heal when it is sick. 
51.3% of overweight adults are metabolically healthy. Metabolically healthy overweight women are no more likely to die or have a heart attack or stroke than metabolically healthy normal weight women.
Doctors often tell overweight people that losing weight would be good for their health. People usually try to lose weight by eating less. This is called 'dieting'. They may exercise too.
Dieting is often ineffective. 41% of dieters weigh more four to five years after the end of the diet than before it began.
Some people might use herbal teas, powders and pills to help to lower their mass.
Animals can also be overweight.
Overweight is not just associated with bad health. People think that being overweight means that a person is lazy or bad. Overweight people are often treated badly by other people for because of this. This is called fatphobia.
More than 1.4 billion adults are overweight in the world. The amount of overweight people is increasing.

San Nicolas Island

San Nicolas Island is the most farthest from shore of California's Channel Islands. It is part of Ventura County. The 14,562 acre (58.93 km² or 22.753 sq mi) island is used by the United States Navy for a weapons testing and training. The only people who live on the island are about 200 people with the military. The island has a small airport and several buildings.
San Nicolas was once the home of the Nicoleño people, who were probably related to the Tongva of the mainland and Santa Catalina Island. It was named for Saint Nicholas by Spanish sailor Sebastián Vizcaíno after he saw the island on the saint's feast day (December 6) in 1602. Vizcaíno reported that there were a lot of people living on the island. By 1800 the number of people on the island had gone down. In 1811 a group of Kodiak men from Alaska were put on to San Nicholas to hunt otters. They fought with the Nicoleños. When the Kodiaks left there were less than 100 of the original population left. By 1835 the population was about 12. The Nicoleños were taken off the island in the 1835 by the members of the California mission system. Within a few years of leaving the island the Nicoleño all died. 
The most famous person from San Nicolas Island was the "Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island". She was left on the island in 1835 when the rest of the Nicoleños were moved to the missions. She lived on the island alone for 18 years before she was found and brought back to Santa Barbara in 1853. By this time there was no-one left who could speak her language. Her real name was never known, but as she was dying she was named Juana Maria. She died from dysentery seven weeks later. Her story was used for Scott O'Dell's award winning 1961 novel "Island of the Blue Dolphins". Today, a commemorative plaque about her life has been placed on the back of the east bell tower at Mission Santa Barbara. In 2012 scientists rediscovered a buried cave on the island where they believe the woman lived.
From 1957 and 1973, and in 2004, U.S.roc kets were launched from San Nicolas Island.
There few kinds of plants and animals on San Nicolas Island. Sheep ate many of the plants before they were taken away in 1943. Even so, there are several plants that can only be found on the island. Three kinds of animals are there and nowhere else: deer mouse, island fox, and island night lizard. The island also has many birds.

Vladimir Kozlov

Oleg Aleksandrovich Prudius (born April 27, 1979) is a Ukrainian American professional wrestler, also known by his ring name Vladimir Kozlov. He is currently signed to Inoki Genome Federation. He also worked for WWE from 2006 to 2011. He is trained in freestyle wrestling, rugby, American football, sambo, kickboxing, judo, and mixed martial arts.
Prudius has also worked as a stage and screen actor, having a small part in Spike Lee's "25th Hour". Kozlov also had a role in "Grindhouse", appearing in the "Werewolf Women of the SS" trailer; he was credited under his real name and his WWE persona for the appearance. He is a former Ohio Valley Wrestling Heavyweight Champion.
On December 8, 2009, Prudius became a United States citizen.
Prudius has won numerous achievements, becoming the 2005 USA Open Heavyweight Sambo Champion
and a United States Kick-Boxing Association (USKBA) International Heavyweight Grappling Champion. He has also played American football for the Ukrainian National Team as well as Santa Barbara City College.
Prudius accompanied Jerry Jarrett to the ring at Slammiversary in 2005.
On January 17, 2006, World Wrestling Entertainment announced that Prudius had signed a developmental deal and was sent to Deep South Wrestling. On April 7, 2006 he started wrestling under his real name "Oleg Prudius" and had his first match in DSW against Tommy Suede.
On May 5, 2006, Prudius had his first untelevised WWE match during a house show in San Jose, California, defeating Rob Conway. The next night, at another house show in Sacramento, California, Matt Striker cut a promo on Prudius, calling him a "filthy immigrant," causing Prudius to attack him. Prudius then picked up the microphone and said he that he is "proud to be in America."
On the December 18, 2006 episode of "Raw", Prudius made an appearance as a WWE prospect named Vladimir Kozlov, which became his ring name. For the next several weeks, Kozlov was interviewed on WWE programming, proclaiming his love for "Double Double E" (WWE), but drawing some heel heat for declaring his superiority over whatever wrestlers were competing at the time.
On July 28, 2007 in Louisville, Kentucky, he won the OVW Heavyweight Championship by defeating Paul Burchill, but gave up the Championship the same night to Michael W. Kruel due to an agreement they made before.
On the April 4, 2008 episode of "SmackDown", Kozlov made his official WWE debut as a villain, with the unique quirk of having no entrance music and no TitanTron video – his "entrance" consisted of complete darkness except for a spotlight following him to the ring. He defeated Matt Bentley in his first match, and over the following weeks, Kozlov would win a series of matches. On the July 11, 2008 airing of "SmackDown", Kozlov debuted an entrance theme and TitanTron video as he defeated Stevie Richards.
In the following weeks, as Kozlov continued to easily win matches, he began demanding "better competition". On the September 12, 2008 edition of "SmackDown", he attacked Jeff Hardy. Over the following weeks, Kozlov would continue attacking both Hardy and the WWE Champion Triple H, eventually starting a loose rivalry between the three of them over the WWE title. Kozlov earned a match against Triple H for the WWE Championship at Survivor Series by defeating The Undertaker by disqualification on the November 6 episode of "SmackDown". Edge was added to the match while it was in progress, and pinned Triple H to win the match. This is because Jeff Hardy was originally supposed to compete, but was found unconscious in a Boston stairwell. At Armageddon, Kozlov gained his first pay-per-view win by defeating then-ECW Champion Matt Hardy in a non-title match. Kozlov competed in the 2009 Royal Rumble match, entering number 6, but was eliminated by Triple H after eliminating three other superstars including The Great Khali, MVP, and Carlito.
Prudius has made many television appearances. He appeared in the second season of the HBO drama series "The Wire", as well as "Roksalana" and "It's Not To Easy" on Ukrainian TV. In 2002, he appeared in Spike Lee's film "25th Hour", playing a Russian mafia enforcer. He appeared in the Russian military theatre play "Victory Day" and a Ukraine University play "Three Musketeers".

Help:Categories

MediaWiki allows you to categorize pages by appending one or more Category tags to the content text. Adding these tags makes links at the bottom of the article which take you to the list of all pages in that category. This makes it easy to browse related articles.
A category will be made when you use the name you want the category to be as a link at the bottom of the page as explained next. It will not show, however, until the first linking page is Saved. Before that, it will show as an empty link in red. Afterwords, it will begin automatically compiling a Contents page of all such pages with the link on them. 
You should be even more careful about doing this than adding content pages. Unlike content pages, categories cannot be deleted or renamed, remaining to confuse users browsing the list of categories. Before attempting to make a Category, please find the list of all Categories by clicking on "Special pages" in the left sidebar "toolbox" box. Check the contents of any other category that might suggest the one you wanted to make.
To add a content page to the listing for a Category, simply put the following at the very bottom of the page you are editing:
Any number of category tags may be added to the page -- the page will be listed in all of them.
You can also specify an additional SORT parameter that specifies where the page will appear, alphabetically, within the category. This is done by using the following markup:
To add this page to the 'Help' category to be located in the list at 'C' you would use:
Without this, the page would be listed under 'H' for 'Help:Categories', instead of under 'C'. Another example is when you have articles about people that are called codice_1 but within a particular category you want them listed as codice_2.
Another way to sort an article in the correct letter group without using the 'namespace' is:
This is helpful when using templates which include a category tag.
To make a link within page content, use a leading colon as in
For example, if the name were "Help" the link would look like . Without the leading colon, it would be instead blank or red in the text, because there is no such content page linked within that category.
If you want to show different text for the link, add that after a bar as with other internal links:
The same link to Category:Help as above might show this different text: 
Categories themselves and other uploaded files like images can be categorized like content pages. It is useful to connect the article-categories with categories already in place to establish connections. After saving the article, follow the category links at the end of the page to see if the category is already in place and if not, categorize them until you connect them with an existing category.
Categories cannot be easily moved . For this reason, category names should be chosen carefully.
Those with admin tools can make the new page, delete the old one, and then change the category tags in each member of the category (manually or with a bot). However, this loses the page History - not a huge problem when categories are used only for navigation. But when a wiki is structured so that the category pages have significant amounts of text, this is not very good.
If the old categories are not deleted, the text in them should be replaced by the following:
However, category pages "can" be moved together with the full revision history, with some effort, by using the and tools.

Help:Deleting a page

Typically you would delete a page if the contents are entirely inappropriate and do not match the purposes of the Wiki. In other situations, you would take a less extreme course of action, for example:
An actual delete is generally necessary only if the "title" of the page is inappropriate. In other situations, a merge and redirect is more appropriate.
Deciding on appropriate content/page titles can be a difficult aspect of Wiki organization, and one which can often provoke debates. If the merge or deletion you have in mind is one which might cause upset, you should propose the change first. Do this by leaving a note to give your reasons on the . You might also establish a system for labeling the page with a delete/merge proposal template, to make everybody aware of your intentions.
The 'What links here' toolbox feature (bottom of left sidebar) will tell you which other Wiki pages link to the current page. Always use this feature to check before proceeding with deleting. These related pages will need to be edited for their links to reflect the change.
Normal users cannot permanently delete a Wiki page. This is a deliberate design feature, and is an important part of why wikis work. Every kind of editing operation can be reverted by any other user, and that includes resurrecting deleted content. It does not cause significant wasted space; and with nothing but a 'delete' label, the page is effectively deleted anyway.
" "are" able to delete a page semi-permanently. See . Typically 'sysops' might look for delete labels, and do a proper delete on these pages, after a period of time. If for some reason you need a page to be deleted more quickly than that, you will need to contact a 'sysop' to request this.

Or with different text:
If it is enabled on your wiki (see ), you can also embed external images. To do that, simply insert the image's url:
It's easy to make a gallery of thumbnails only, not other images, with the codice_26: sets a caption on the gallery.

However, there are several workarounds for those that require them.
Native image link support was added in . See .
If you only have sysop access to the Wiki, these are your best options.
The most simplistic method, if your requirements for external images are specialized (that is, restricted to one page or one image), is to add a CSS rule to your MediaWiki:Common.css (or other CSS files, such as MediaWiki:Skinname.css or /skins/skinname/main.css, etc.) giving child links of a certain class of object a background image. This method also has some security, as it requires editing the site-wide CSS files, meaning only sysops have access to modify the image shown. 
For example (red sections are parts to configure for each image):
In MediaWiki:Common.css:
In your wikicode:
This would give the link the background image specified, as well as the width and height of the image (which you have to set manually). To find the location of an uploaded file, go to the image description page and click the image itself, and copy the image location in the address bar. 
For example on , the image location is http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/mediawiki/b/bc/Wiki.png (location format will differ depending on local settings), and the width and height would be set to 135px and 135px. So to make a link to the main page here using that logo, one would add to :
And then use the wikicode:
Which would give you:
You can also use a thumbnail of an image, but make sure the thumbnail is being used elsewhere, as most installations are not configured to generate thumbnails on demand.
You can also attempt to superimpose an invisible link over an image via CSS, such as is done in . An example of a typical click template is:
Known problems: It doesn't work in text-only browsers, and in screen readers for the disabled, and possibly other situations. The technique of using to change page content also completely breaks an article's by contravening a priority-one checkpoint.
A less elegant trick is to make the image description page a redirect to the target. So for example would be changed to content:
There are several disadvantages to this:
If you have server access, but do not want to install any extensions, these solutions may work for you.
If you enable (which allows external images from any domain) or (which restricts the list of domains), anyone can then easily create an "external" link to an "external" image. External simply means: using the full URL rather than a local link, so you can link locally, but you need to use the full URL. The plainlinks class is used to remove the "external link" icon:
So for example, were external images allowed here, you could link to the with http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/mediawiki/b/bc/Wiki.png using wikicode like:
This has the disadvantage of not registering the link, or the image use, as well as not being easily portable to forks and mirrors.
If you enable , you can use <img> tags freely, but this method is highly insecure.
There are, however, some extensions to make it safer, see for details.
If you are willing to install an extension, several extensions have been created to address this issue:
Or you can invent your own linked image syntax, by writing an extension that registers it as a parser hook. See for information on extending MediaWiki syntax.
If you want, you can do some more drastic things, such as modify /includes/Sanitizer.php (where the HTML tag whitelist is), and add <img /> to the list of allowed tags.

Help:Link

There are four sorts of links in MediaWiki: 
To add an internal link, enclose the name of the page you want to link to in double square brackets. When you save the page, you'll see the new link pointing to your page. If the page exists already, it is displayed in blue, empty pages are displayed in red. Selflinks to the current page are not transformed in URLs but displayed in bold.
The first letter of the target page is automatically capitalized and spaces are represented as underscores (typing an underscore in the link will have a similar effect as typing a space, but is not recommended, since the underscore will also be shown in the text).
By default, when you write a URL as is, it will be transformed to an external link.
To avoid that effect, put the URL between <nowiki> start & end tags as in:
Interwiki links are links from the local wiki to another wiki. For example you can link to the Sunflower article on wikipedia.org by typing w:Sunflower. This results in a link like this: w:Sunflower
Similar to internal page links, you can create piped links, with alternate link text. e.g. big yellow flower
Basically this is an abbreviation for longer URLs. A very similar link could be created as a normal external link by typing Sunflower, but interwiki links allow you to type out an easy and compact link, almost as if you are linking to a page on your own wiki.
Some interesting things to note:

Help:Managing files

If file uploads are enabled, you can upload certain types of files to the wiki. This is particularly useful for uploading images, which you want to place on an article, but you can also upload other types of files.
If it is a large file, you may need to wait several seconds for the upload to complete.
After you've uploaded a file, you can use it in an article, with some special wiki syntax to create the link. See .
Your file gets its very own 'Image Description Page' within the wiki (even if it isn't an image). You should edit this page to provide more information about the file. For example, many public wiki projects are quite sensitive to copyright issues, and so you should explain where you got the file from, and what its copyright status is, on the description page. Any other useful descriptive notes could also be added there.
There are a number of Special Pages to help you view and manage files which have been uploaded. Go to 'Special Pages' (in the toolbox on the left) and then see...
See for details of the other information available here.

Help:Moving a page

Moving (renaming) a page means giving it another name. This is done by using "" tab at the top. Then simply enter the new name and click 'Move Page'. Normally you would want to leave "Move associated talk page" option ticked. 
If you move page "A" to a new title "B", this operation will do the following:
The third point is important. By using the 'Move' feature, you also move the editing history, which is desirable in most situations. The editing history allows people to see how the contents of the page were built up, and who contributed what. If you move contents around by copying and pasting (not using the move feature), you do not achieve this (see also ).
Because the move operation leaves behind a redirect (see ), it should not result in any broken links, however you might want to hunt down pages or other redirects which link in to the redirect, and change their text to link directly to the new title. The 'What links here' toolbox feature (bottom left) is useful when doing this.
Deciding on a page title can be a difficult aspect of wiki organization, and one which can often provoke debates. If the move you have in mind is one which might cause upset or could be considered controversial, you should propose the move first. Do this by leaving a note to give your reasons on the . You might also establish a system for labelling the page itself, with a move proposal template, to make everybody aware of your intentions.
As with all wiki editing, a move operation can be reversed (by any user). To reverse a move operation, simply move the page back, e.g. move page "B" back to "A".
The page title "B" will still be left behind, as a redirect from "B" to "A". Any user can remove the redirect and propose that the page be deleted. However the final deletion will can only be done by an administrator (see ).
New users and IP users are not able to move pages until they have become . They will need to have a registered account for more than four days, and made more than 10 edits.
